    "After working with the floods data, we thought to expand to other disasters. I chose 'earthquakes' as my query, and labeled articles containing the word 'earthquake' as relevant or not relelvant to a disaster. This proved tricky though - many articles were indeed about earthquakes, but none pertaining to a DISASTER, just an event (small earthquake of 3.7 reported in the Indian Ocean, for example). Our classes for this topic also proved HUGELY unbalanced, which could cause major problems in our modeling. "

       "  'content': 'BALAKOT, Pakistan (Reuters) - Villagers near the town of Balakot in northeast Pakistan were shaken out of their sleep by what seemed like an earthquake in the early hours of Tuesday, only discovering once dawn broke that there had been an Indian airstrike on their neighborhood. \\r\\nIndian officials said the raid destroyed a training camp of Jaish-e- Mohammed, the militant group behind a suicide attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 40 members of a paramilitary police force on Feb. 14. India’s foreign secretary said “a very large number of JEM terrorists” had been eliminated in what was the first Indian air strike on Pakistani territory since 1971. \\r\\nThe villagers, however, said only one person was wounded in the attack and they knew of no fatalities. \\r\\nA resident, who did not want to give his name, said there was a nearby madrasa run by Jaish, though most villagers were guarded talking about their militant neighbors. \\r\\n“There is this madrasa on the hilltop. The Jaish-e-Mohammed runs it,” he said. \\r\\nAnother person, who also declined to give his name said the militants had had a presence in the area for years. \\r\\n“I belong to that area. I know for sure that there has been a training camp. It used to be there. I know Jaish people ran it,” he said. \\r\\n“This camp was turned into a madrasa several years ago, but no one would still be allowed to get close to this infrastructure. There are scores of students in the madrasa at any given time,” he said. \\r\\nSet in a wooded, hilly area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on the way to the scenic Kaghan valley, some 40 kilometers from the de facto border with India, Balakot was of many towns that was devastated by as massive earthquake in 2005. \\r\\nFrom what villagers could see, the Indian attack had missed its target as the bombs dropped exploded about a kilometer away from the madrasa. \\r\\nMohammad Ajmal, a 25 year-old villager near Jaba Top, where the attack took place, said he had heard four loud bangs in succession just before 3.00 a.m. (2200 GMT). \\r\\n“We couldn’t tell what had happened. It was only in the morning that we figured out it was an attack,” he told Reuters after visiting the site, in a wooded hilltop area. \\r\\n“We saw fallen trees and one damaged house, and four craters where the bombs had fallen.” \\r\\nFida Hussain Shah, a 46 year-old farmer, said he and other villagers had found pieces of Indian ordnance that had splintered pine trees on the hill but the only casualty was a man sleeping in his house when shrapnel broke the windows. \\r\\nAdditional reporting by Jibran Ahmad in PESHAWAR; writing by James Mackenzie; Editing Cameron-Moore'},\n",

       "  'content': '(CNN)After a gunman killed 17 people on the campus of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the letters from strangers across the world arrived in bulk, touching the survivors of the mass shooting. \\r\\nWe love you, people wrote to the students in Parkland, Florida. We care about you. You will bounce back from this.\\r\\nThe letters helped the students heal. Now, they want to help families of victims of last week\\'s shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, cope by writing letters to them and community residents.\\r\\nThe letter writing campaign began Wednesday. It will involve the student body and, possibly, South Florida Muslims, Koerber said.\\r\\nThe Parkland students grew connected to the Christchurch community they visited New Zealand last July on a learning and healing trip.\\r\\nThey planted trees in memory of their classmates who were killed on Valentine\\'s Day 2018 and met with members of the Student Volunteer Army -- a movement that started afer an earthquake in Christchurch in 2011 -- about sustaining their own youth movement that grew out of the shooting on the Parkland campus. \\r\\n\"We got letters after our tragedy, that was something that really surprised us,\" said Kai Koerber, a Stoneman Douglas senior who visited Christchurch last year. \"It\\'s something that really warmed the hearts of people in my community. I think it will warm the hearts of people in Christchurch as well.\"\\r\\n\\'Parkland stands with you\\'\\r\\nAccording to law enforcement, a self-avowed white supremacist killed 50 people at Al Noor and Lindwood mosques in Christchurch on Friday. \\r\\nKoerber learned about the shootings from a friend in a New Zealand. He learned another friend from the volunteer army knew one of the victims in the killings. \\r\\nThe senior shared the news in a group chat with fellow students who were on the trip, and they began discussing ways to help the Christchurch community.\\r\\n\"I\\'m really upset that they have to know firsthand what\\'s it\\'s like to have people senselessly gun down in their country,\" Koerber said. \"I\\'m really upset that the proliferation of white supremacist-based violence has reached a place that I thought was almost untouchable as far as gun violence is concerned.\"\\r\\nIn the letters to the people he met in Christchurch, Koerber said, he will write in \"big, voluminous detail about how that I care about that them, and how much I know they\\'re going to bounce back because I know who they are.\"\\r\\nIn his letters to strangers, he\\'ll tell them: \"Parkland stands with you. We have been there.\"\\r\\nUnfamiliar with gun violence\\r\\nThe students from Parkland quickly realized how unfamiliar their New Zealand counterparts were with gun violence. \\r\\nAccording to figures from the University of Sydney, New Zealand had 0.17 gun-related homicides per 100,000 people in 2015. In contrast, the United States had 11 deaths per 100,000 people that year, according to a report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \\r\\n\"For a lot of us, we were very surprised at how that dichotomous that relationship was in that respect,\" Koerber said. \\r\\nEmily Wolfman, a junior at Stoneman Douglas, recalled how one student in New Zealand who attended a panel discussion with students from Parkland struggled to understand what they were going through. \\r\\n\"The student was genuinely apologizing to us because he didn\\'t know how to empathize with us,\" Emilysaid.\\r\\nThe 17-year-old said she understood the difficultly the student was having relating to the gun violence. \\r\\n\"It\\'s hard. No one tells you how to deal with something like this,\" she said.\\r\\nUntil Friday\\'s shooting, the deadliest massacre in the country\\'s history happened 30 years ago when a man killed 13 people. \\r\\nImmediately after the recent shootings, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern vowed to reform the country\\'s gun laws.\\r\\nKoerber said he believes it is easier for a smaller country like New Zealand to come to quick solutions.\\r\\n\"The stagnation of the American legislative process and political process is due to the absolute magnitude and size of our country,\" he said, regarding gun control. \\r\\nHe added: \"Gun violence is this country is being overseen by companies that are not thinking morally, but thinking fiscally.\" \\r\\nSince the shooting, Parkland students have made it their mission to advocate for gun control. They adopted the rallying cry \"#NeverAgain, and a nascent movement was born.\\r\\nTheyhave lobbied Florida lawmakers and led a historic march for gun control, what they called a \"March for Our Lives.\" \\r\\nWeeks after the 2011 earthquake, the SVA was moved to similar action. \\r\\nThe club says it dispatched more than 13,000 volunteers to help with cleanup after the quake. Over time, the organization has moved from largely disaster response to community engagement. Students who were children during the earthquake now run the club. \\r\\nThe group is also behind a larger initiative to get New Zealanders to do community service around Anzac Day, the country\\'s memorial day for veterans, the group said. \\r\\nJosh Blackmore, president of SVA, told Morning Report that sustaining the momentum over time is a challenge.\\r\\n\"It\\'s always incredible for us to talk to other student movements that have been born from tragedy in other places of the world,\" he said before the Parkland students visited.\\r\\nKoerber said he and other students wanted to \"figure out how we can get people to be consistently enthused in our cause.\" They compared notes, and discovered they needed to be organized and have the passion to sustain a movement. \\r\\n\"Being that their problem was the earthquake and ours we gun violence, we found a common ground,\" he said. \"Either way, it still affected people in negative way.\" \\r\\nThe groups created a guide for starting and sustaining a youth movement.\\r\\nA flood of emotions again\\r\\nFor Emily,the shootings in Christchurch triggered a flood of memories. \\r\\n\"Everyone was really emotional. It was really hard because we all thought we had healed,\" she said of fellow students, including those who went to New Zealand.\\r\\nFor the first time in about a month, she was emotional again.\\r\\n After the shooting, she sensed the mood was different when she walked in to the class of one of the chaperones of the New Zealand trip.\\r\\n\"You could just tell how upset and distraught how everyone was by it,\" she said.\\r\\n\"We went to New Zealand in order to look at a completely different culture,\" Emily said. \"And, suddenly, that culture is the same thing as ours.\" \\r\\nCNN\\'s Eliott C.

       "  'content': 'Katia Hetter, CNNUpdated 20th March 2019\\r\\n(CNN) Finland has a lot to celebrate.\\r\\nIt\\'s followed by Denmark, Norway, Iceland and The Netherlands. \\r\\nThe World Happiness Report was released by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network for the United Nations on March 20, the United Nations has declared to be International Day of Happiness. \\r\\nThe report ranks countries on six key variables that support well-being: income, freedom, trust, healthy life expectancy, social support and generosity. \\r\\n\"The top 10 countries tend to rank high in all six variables, as well as emotional measures of well-being,\" says report co-editor John Helliwell, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of British Columbia.\\r\\nAnd that\\'s not just about the native-born residents of those countries. \"It\\'s true that last year all Finns were happier than rest of the countries\\' residents, but their immigrants were also happiest immigrants in the world,\" Helliwell. \"It\\'s not about Finnish DNA. It\\'s the way life is lived in those countries. \\r\\nThey pay high taxes for a social safety net, they trust their government, they live in freedom and they are generous with each other. \"They do care about each other,\" he says. \"That\\'s the kind of place people want to live.\"\\r\\nDifferences among the top eight countries are small enough that jostling among the top five is expected every year. \\r\\nSwitzerland came in sixth place, followed by Sweden, New Zealand, Canada (the only country in the Americas) and Austria. \\r\\nThe 2019 list only changed a little, with Austria nudged Australia out of the top 10 list. Australia dropped one spot to 11th place. \\r\\nSupport in difficult times\\r\\nRanking high in happiness doesn\\'t protect a country\\'s people from violence or trauma, as the recent attack on a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand shows. But the response of New Zealand\\'s people to the attack does. \\r\\nNew Zealand came in eighth place this year, as it did last year. \\r\\n\"What stands out about the happiest and most well connected societies is their resilience and ability to deal with bad things,\" says Helliwell. \"After the 2011 earthquake and now the terrorist attack in Christchurch -- with high social capital, where people are connected -- people rally and help each other and (in after the earthquake) rebuild immediately.\"\\r\\nThe United States came in 19th place, dropping one spot since last year and a total of five spots since 2017. \\r\\nExcept for its 10th place ranking for income, the US doesn\\'t rank in the top 10 on measures that make up a happy country in the UN report. They include 12th place for generosity, 37th place for social support, 61st place for freedom and 42nd place for corruption.\\r\\nAddiction is partly to blame, says report co-author Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, who wrote a chapter focused on the US epidemic of addictions and on unhappiness in America, a rich country where happiness has been declining.\\r\\nThis year\\'s report provides sobering evidence of how addictions are causing considerable unhappiness and depression in the US,\" says Sachs, in a press release. \"Addictions come in many forms, from substance abuse to gambling to digital media. The compulsive pursuit of substance abuse and addictive behaviors is causing severe unhappiness.\"\\r\\nSocial connections are weakening in the US as social media usage is raising anxiety, especially among adolescents, says Helliwell.\\r\\nSuperpowers are not super happy\\r\\nNo other super powers made it into the top 10 rankings, either. The United Kingdom came in 15th place, up from 18th place, while Germany came in 17th place, down from 15th. Japan came in 58th place (down from 54th), Russia came in 68th place (down from 59th) and China came in 93rd place (down from 86th). \\r\\nPeople in South Sudan are the most unhappy with their lives, according to the survey of 156 countries, followed by Central African Republic (155), Afghanistan (154), Tanzania (153) and Rwanda (152). \\r\\nBolstered by population growth, overall world happiness has fallen over the past few years, which has mostly been fueled by a sustained drop in India, which came in 140th place this year (versus 133rd place in 2018). There has also been an increase of negative emotions, which were also measured and include worry, sadness and anger. \\r\\nThe prime minister of the tiny country of Bhutan proposed a World Happiness Day to the United Nations in 2011, which brought international attention to happiness as a metric. Bhutan came in 95th place (up two spots from last year) in this year\\'s report. \\r\\nIn 2012, the United Nations General Assembly declared March 20 as World Happiness Day, recognizing \"the relevance of happiness and well-being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the world and the importance of their recognition in public policy objectives.\"\\r\\nThis report is the seventh to come out since 2012. The rankings of the world\\'s happiest countries came from an analysis of data from surveys in 156 countries, including the Gallup World Poll starting in 2005-2006.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'A new city policy requiring public signs on brick buildings warning they might collapse in an earthquake is part of a long history of white supremacy aimed at forcing black people to move out of neighborhoods, the NAACP of Portland, Oregon, says.\\r\\nThe group on Thursday decried the policy affecting some 1,600 unreinforced masonry buildings that are on average 90 years old, many in areas with a predominantly black population, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports .\\r\\nThe policy \"exacerbates a long history of systemic and structural betrayals of trust and policies of displacement, demolition, and dispossession predicated on classism, racism, and white supremacy,\" the group said.\\r\\nThe NAACP said the policy will make it tougher for owners of brick buildings to get loans and will discourage investment. It says that means buildings will have to be sold, and that developers will demolish and redevelop, increasing the cost to live there and forcing current residents out.\\r\\n\"It speaks to our houses of worship and everything about the black presence in the North-Northeast area,\" said the Rev. E.D. Mondaine, a pastor at Celebration Tabernacle Church in north Portland and president of the Portland NAACP chapter.\\r\\nCity officials say the ordinance approved in October is part of an effort ultimately aimed at upgrading old buildings to withstand an earthquake, though seismic upgrades likely wouldn\\'t be required for at least 20 years. Such upgrades could cost brick-building owners millions of dollars.\\r\\nExperts say Portland is at risk because there\\'s close to a 50 percent chance of a giant earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone off the Oregon coast in the next 50 years.\\r\\nThe warning signs and a requirement that building owners must file a record of compliance is \"really just a disclosure,\" said Alex Cousins, a spokesman for the city Bureau of Development Services. \"That\\'s the purpose behind it.\"\\r\\nThe warning signs are to go up on public buildings this month, and on most other buildings by March 1. The warning on them says: \"This is an unreinforced masonry building. Unreinforced masonry buildings may be unsafe in the event of a major earthquake.\"\\r\\nIn related action, a nonprofit coalition of Portland brick building owners recently filed a lawsuit seeking to block the ordinance, arguing it\\'s unconstitutional under free-speech and due-process rights.\\r\\n\"The government is forcing private property owners to basically broadcast the government\\'s message instead of their own,\" said John DiLorenzo, an attorney for the group.\\r\\nAlso, a coalition of music venues called MusicPortland has sided with the NAACP, saying the ordinance threatens some 30 of its music venues.\\r\\n———\\r\\nInformation from: The Oregonian/OregonLive, http://www.oregonlive.com'},\n",

       "  'content': 'YANCHENG, China (Reuters) - Rescuers pulled a survivor from rubble early on Saturday in the wake of a massive explosion at a pesticide plant in eastern China that flattened buildings, blew out windows more than a mile away and killed at least 64 people. \\r\\nOfficials said more than two dozen people were still missing and hundreds had been injured in Thursday’s blast at the Chenjiagang Industrial Park in the city of Yancheng, in Jiangsu province on China’s east coast. \\r\\nThe cause of the explosion was under investigation, but an editorial in the China Daily newspaper speculated it was likely to be identified as “a serious accident caused by human negligence”. \\r\\nThe company, Tianjiayi Chemical Co - which produces more than 30 organic chemical compounds, some highly flammable - had been cited and fined for work safety violations in the past, the China Daily had reported. \\r\\nAt the Xiangshui People’s Hospital on Saturday morning, the ward corridors were filled with temporary beds for the wounded. \\r\\n“I was just going to collect my wages when it blew up,” said a worker who identified himself as Zuo. His head was covered in bloody gauze. \\r\\n“I don’t even have a home to go to now,” he said. \\r\\nThe hospital was relying on dozens of unpaid volunteers. \\r\\n“No one is thinking about how people will pay their medical bills at the moment - the priority is rescuing them and worrying about fees later,” said one volunteer surnamed Jiang, who was sent to help out at the hospital by his employers on Friday. \\r\\nPublic anger over safety standards has grown in China over industrial accidents, ranging from mining disasters to factory fires, that have marred three decades of swift economic growth. \\r\\nIn 2015, 165 people were killed in explosions at a chemical warehouse in the northern city of Tianjin, one of the world’s busiest ports, which is not far from the capital, Beijing. \\r\\nThose blasts were big enough to be seen by satellites and register on earthquake sensors. \\r\\nDespite repeated government pledges to tighten safety, disasters have hit chemical plants in particular, with 23 people killed in November in a series of blasts during the delivery of a flammable gas at a chemical maker. \\r\\nAfter the blast in Yancheng, police, some wearing face masks, sealed off roads to what was left of the devastated, smoldering plant. \\r\\nThe explosion smashed windows in the village of Wangshang 2 km (1.2 miles) away. Stunned villagers likened it to an earthquake. \\r\\nA provincial official told Reuters on Saturday the accident has shown that the market for dangerous chemicals has grown too quickly and production to meet demand has expanded too crudely. \\r\\nPresident Xi Jinping, who is in Italy on a state visit, ordered all-out efforts to care for the injured and to “earnestly maintain social stability”, state television said. \\r\\nAuthorities must step up action to prevent such incidents and determine the cause of the blast as quickly as possible, Xi said. \\r\\n“There has recently been a series of major accidents, and all places and relevant departments must fully learn the lessons from these,” the report cited Xi as saying. \\r\\nCheng Jie, an official with the environment bureau, told reporters the priority was to ensure contaminated water doesn’t leak into the public water supply system. \\r\\nThe Jiangsu environmental protection bureau said late on Friday that a team of 126 inspectors found various degrees of contamination in local water samples, with nitrobenzene concentrations exceeding standards at one location. \\r\\nSome volatile organic chemical measurements far exceeded surface water standards, 15 times over in one case, the Jiangsu bureau said. \\r\\nReporting by David Stanway; Writing by John Ruwitch; Editing by Tom Hogue'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Nearly 40 years after its founding, Ciudad Abierta remains a perpetual work in progress. Fourteen habitable structures including workshops, meeting halls and houses, some occupied full time, others intermittently mark the desolate landscape. Constructed from wood, canvas and brick, the buildings are complex and spontaneous, like maps of the wind. In La Alcoba, the home of the professor and architect Patricio Cáraves Silva, 67, ceilings sweep upward like the hulls of canoes and windows serve not to frame views but to channel light. The house, like Izquierdos, faces every way at once. If a building has a facade, Silva says, then the rest is just a result. Its the least natural thing in the world to think of only one side of something.\\r\\nThe ideas proposed by the Valparaíso School have rarely been implemented in their pure form outside the Ciudad Abierta, but, says P.U.C.s Oyarzun, they ended up infiltrating every architecture school in Chile. Though Pugas Bahía Azul claims its place with a defiance you would never see at the Ciudad Abierta, its final form also evolved during excavation. Casa Ciens floor plan is more rigid than La Alcoba, but it shares its limited palette of materials and powerful interiority. And while the new generation of Chilean architects focuses more on concrete reality than literary abstraction, their work, Oyarzun adds, conveys some of that poetic dimension that the Valparaíso School wanted to attribute to architecture.\\r\\nNo house better expresses that synthesis than the House for the Poem of the Right Angle, by Smiljan Radic, 58, born in Santiago to parents of Croatian descent. In the last 20 years, Radic has built two houses and renovated another on the same plot of land in Vilches, a pastoral village at the edge of the Andes, where the parents of his partner, the sculptor Marcella Correa, spent summer weekends for decades. The first project, called Casa Chica, built in 1996, was a 258-square-foot glass box set between two stone walls embedded in a hillside. For the second, Casa A, Radic opened the front and back of the familys A-frame cabin, originally built in the 1960s, to the surrounding forest and set it on a platform approached by a shallow ramp so you could arrive on horseback if you wanted, Radic wrote in a text published in 2008, upon the completion of the house. Four years later, after Casa A had collapsed in an earthquake in 2010, Radic built the House for the Poem of the Right Angle.\\r\\nEntering the lot from an unpaved track that winds deep into the forest, the first thing you see is the attic of a transparent cabin built with walls of polycarbonate, where Radic and Correas young daughter goes to paint. Facing the cabin across a clearing, the House for the Poem of the Right Angle looks alive, a complex organism that has evolved over the last 20 years from a square to a triangle to an indefinable, multifaceted geometry. (The space where Casa A once stood remains empty; Casa Chica is now a plunge pool.) At only 1,991 square feet, the house is intimate, idiosyncratic and inscrutable, a pure emanation of Radics imagination. Stepping into the interior filled with the resinous scent of the Bolivian cedar that lines its walls, floors and ceilings feels like entering the knothole of a tree. Like the houses of Aravena and Puga, Radics building is an intervention in nature rather than an organic outgrowth of it. But its shape, impossible to grasp at a single glance, looks more like La Alcoba: alive, kinetic, still evolving.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — New research released after years of being kept under wraps captures a fossilized snapshot of the day nearly 66 million years ago when an asteroid smacked Earth, fire rained from the sky and the ground shook far worse than any modern earthquake.\\r\\nIt was the day that nearly all life on Earth went extinct, including the dinosaurs.\\r\\nThe researchers say they found evidence in North Dakota of the asteroid hit in Mexico, including fish with hot glass in their gills from flaming debris that showered back down on Earth. They also reported the discovery of charred trees, evidence of an inland tsunami and melted amber.\\r\\nSeparately, University of Amsterdam\\'s Jan Smit disclosed that he and his colleagues even found dinosaur footsteps from just before their demise.\\r\\nSmit said the footprints — one from a plant-eating hadrosaur and the other of a meat eater, maybe a small Tyrannosaurus Rex — is \"definite proof that the dinosaurs were alive and kicking at the time of impact ... They were running around, chasing each other\" when they were swamped.\\r\\n\"This is the death blow preserved at one particular site. This is just spectacular,\" said Purdue University geophysicist and impact expert Jay Melosh, who wasn\\'t part of the research but edited the paper released Friday by the journal\\xa0Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\\r\\nMelosh called it the field\\'s \"discovery of the century.\" But other experts said that while some of the work is fascinating, they have some serious concerns about the research, including the lack of access to this specific\\xa0Hell Creek Formation\\xa0fossil site for outside scientists. Hell Creek — which spans Montana, both Dakotas and Wyoming — is a fossil treasure trove that includes numerous types of dinosaurs, mammals, reptiles and fish trapped in clay and stone from 65 to 70 million years ago.\\r\\nKirk Johnson, director of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History who also has studied the Hell Creek area for 38 years, said that the work on the fish, the glass and trees \"demonstrates some of the details of what happened on THE DAY. That\\'s all quite interesting and very valid stuff.\" But Johnson said that because there is restricted access to the site, other scientists can\\'t confirm the research. Smit said the restrictions were to protect the site from poachers.\\r\\nJohnson also raised concerns about claims made by the main author, Robert DePalma, a University of Kansas doctoral student, that appeared in a New Yorker magazine article published Friday but not in the scientific paper. DePalma did not return an email or phone message seeking comment.\\r\\nThis handout photo obtained March 30, 2019 courtesy by the University of Kansas shows Robert DePalma(L)and field assistant Kylie Ruble(R) excavate fossil carcasses from the Tanis deposit (Credit: ROBERT DEPALMA/AFP/Getty Images)\\r\\nFor decades, the massive asteroid crash that caused the Chicxulub crater in Mexico\\'s Yucatan Peninsula has been considered the likely cause of the mass extinction often called the \"KT boundary\" for the division between two geologic time periods. But some scientists have insisted that massive volcanic activity played a role. Johnson and Melosh said this helps prove the asteroid crash case.\\r\\nThere were only a few dinosaur fossils from that time, but the footsteps are most convincing, Smit said.\\r\\nThere was more than dinosaurs, he said. The site includes ant nests, wasp nests, fragile preserved leaves and fish that were caught in the act of dying. He said that soon after fish die they get swollen bellies and these fossils didn\\'t show swelling.\\r\\nThe researchers said the inland tsunami points to a massive earthquake generated by the asteroid crash, somewhere between a magnitude 10 and 11. That\\'s more than 350 times stronger than the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.\\r\\nPurdue\\'s Melosh said as he read the study, he kept saying \"wow, wow, what a discovery.\"\\r\\nThe details coming out of this are \"mind-blowing,\" he said.'},\n",

The data revealed that the rupture began north of Palu, on a previously unknown fault segment, and in 30 seconds traveled at least 80 miles southward.\\r\\nOn average, the rupture unzipped the crust at a rate of 2.7 miles per second, or 9,700 miles per hour, almost 25 percent faster than is typical. This blistering pace was made possible by an unusually flat, smooth stretch of the fault south of Palu, Dr. Soquets team wrote. Their conclusion was consistent with theoretical models suggesting that only geometrically simple faults could transmit such ruptures.\\r\\nIn the second study, a team led by Han Bao of the University of California, Los Angeles, assembled a second-by-second timeline of the rupture from surface radar imagery and the dense network of seismic stations around the Indian Ocean. This team, too, observed that the rupture outran its S- waves. Much as a motorboat or supersonic jet outruns its wake, the rupture generated an expanding, V-shaped pattern of disruption, known as a Mach cone, behind it.\\r\\nThe team was able to calculate precisely when the different kinds of seismic waves arrived at different monitoring stations. It found that the rupture from the Palu earthquake unfolded in distinct phases, slowing at about 10 seconds and 25 seconds after the initial slip, perhaps because of bends in the fault or variations in rock friction.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Melting glaciers on Mount Everest are revealing the bodies of dead climbers, sparking concern from the organizers of expeditions to the famous peak, according to the BBC.\\r\\nThe BBC reports that global warming is unlocking the deadly mountain’s gruesome secrets. Everest has claimed the lives of almost 300 climbers since the first attempt to conquer the mountain in 1921, two-thirds of whom are buried in the mountain’s ice and snow. In 1953 Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first climbers to reach Everest\\'s summit.\\r\\n\"Because of global warming, the ice sheet and glaciers are fast melting and the dead bodies that remained buried all these years are now becoming exposed,\" Ang Tshering Sherpa, former president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, told the news outlet.\\r\\nSHOCK WARNING ON MELTING GLACIERS IN THE HIMALAYAS\\r\\nThe BBC also interviewed a government official who had retrieved about 10 dead bodies from the mountain in recent years who said that “clearly more and more of them are emerging now.”\\r\\nFILE - in this May 18, 2013 file photo released by mountain guide Adrian Ballinger of Alpenglow Expeditions, a climber pauses on the way to the summit of Mount Everest, in the Khumbu region of the Nepalese Himalayas.\\r\\n (AP Photo/Alpenglow Expeditions, Adrian Ballinger, File)\\r\\nFamous remains on the deadly mountain have included a body dubbed “Green Boots,” by climbers,\\xa0believed to be the corpse of an Indian climber who died while descending from the summit in 1996. The body, wearing neon green climbing boots, became a landmark for climbers, although there are reports that it is no longer visible. In 1999, the well-preserved body of famous British mountaineer George Mallory was discovered on Everest, 75 years after his death. Mallory\\'s remains were subsequently covered with a cairn. It is not clear whether he ever reached Everest\\'s summit.\\r\\nRetrieving bodies from the mountain is fraught with danger. The most difficult bodies to retrieve are near the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit in the low-oxygen area known by mountaineers as the death zone.\\r\\nMOUNT EVEREST\\'S ICE IS MELTING, RESEARCHER CLAIMS\\r\\nIn 2017, a team of local Sherpa climbers recovered the body of an Indian climber that had been on Everest for a year. The expedition sparked heated debate in the mountaineering community about the morality of risking more lives to retrieve bodies from one of the most unforgiving places on Earth.\\r\\nFile photo - This photograph taken on April 26, 2018, shows the Khumbu glacier, one of the longest glaciers in the world and the Everest base camp.\\r\\n (PRAKASH MATHEMA/AFP/Getty Images)\\r\\n\"To get one body off of the mountain, they are risking the lives of 10 more people,” said Tshering\\xa0at the time.\\r\\nThe high-risk expedition to retrieve the body of the Indian climber and two others from Everest was financed with about $92,000 from the Indian state of West Bengal. \"It was a very dangerous operation,\" West Bengal state official Sayeed Ahmed Baba acknowledged. \"It was difficult to find Sherpas who were willing to go. But we had to do it for the families.\"\\r\\nMOUNT EVEREST MADNESS: RECENT DEATHS RAISE CONCERNS OF OVERCROWDING AND INEXPERIENCED CLIMBERS\\r\\nLast year, officials in Nepal confirmed that the bodies of a Japanese climber and a Macedonian climber were found on the mountain.\\xa0Five climbers died on Everest in 2018.\\r\\nFile photo - the Khumbu glacier.\\r\\n (PRAKASH MATHEMA/AFP/Getty Images)\\r\\nThe BBC reports that bodies are also being removed from the northern side of the mountain, which is in China’s autonomous region, Tibet.\\r\\nThe spring climbing season, when weather conditions are best on the world\\'s highest peak, began March 1 and ends May 31.\\r\\nCHINA CLOSES ITS EVEREST BASE CAMP TO TOURISTS AS PART OF CLEAN UP CAMPAIGN\\r\\nThe number of climbers attempting to scale the peak in recent years has even sparked concern about overcrowding, further exacerbating the dangers on the mountain.

A median of 4 people have died on the mountain every year since then, he explained. “Focusing on modern times from\\xa02000 to 2018 deaths have increased to 6 annual deaths, heavily driven by the 28 Sherpa deaths on the South side in 2014 and 2015 from the serac release onto the Icefall and the [Nepal 2015] earthquake,” Arnette said.\\r\\nChina said in January it would reduce the number of climbers by one-third this year as part of plans for a major cleanup of the mountain that straddles the border between the countries. China also closed its Everest base camp to tourists for an indefinite period earlier this year as part of the cleanup effort.\\r\\nNO MORE FAKE VIEWS: NEPAL TESTS GPS-TRACKING DEVICES FOR MOUNT EVEREST CLIMBS\\r\\nScientists have highlighted the impact of climate change on the famous mountain. In 2017, experts from the U.K.’s University of Leeds, University of Sheffield, Aberystwyth University and the National Environmental Research Council (NERC) drilled into the Khumbu Glacier to record temperatures deep below its surface.\\r\\nFile photo - the remains of British mountaineer George Mallory, which were covered with rocks following their discovery in 1999.\\r\\n (Photo by Jake NORTON/Mallory-Irvine/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images)\\r\\nThe Nepali glacier is located on Mount Everest’s slopes.\\r\\nThe research, which was published in the journal Scientific Reports in 2018, revealed: “a minimum ice temperature of only −3.3 °C [26.06 F], with even the coldest ice being a full 2 °C warmer than the mean annual air temperature.”\\r\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\r\\nFile photo - In this photograph taken on April 26, 2015, rocks are kept over flattened tents at Everest Base Camp, to cover the bodies of some of the people that died a day earlier as an earthquake triggered avalanche crashed through parts of the base camp killing scores of people.\\xa0\\r\\n (ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP/Getty Images)\\r\\n“These results indicate that high-elevation Himalayan glaciers are vulnerable to even minor atmospheric warming and will be especially sensitive to future climate warming,” explained the University of Leeds, in a statement.\\r\\nFox News Andrew O’Reilly, Barnini Chakraborty, and The Associated Press contributed to this article.

       "  'content': 'MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Two weeks after a suicide bombing in Kashmir in February killed 40 Indian policemen, a Facebook user called Avi Dandiya posted a live video in which he played a recording of a call purportedly involving India’s home minister, the president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and an unidentified woman. \\r\\nThe trio could be heard talking about arousing nationalist sentiment ahead of India’s general election, with the BJP president allegedly saying in Hindi: “We agree that for election, we need a war”. \\r\\nWithin 24 hours, one of Facebook Inc’s fact-checking partners in India, BOOM, exposed Dandiya’s video as fake. An analysis on BOOM’s website said the video was created by splicing audio from older political interviews. \\r\\nBy the time Facebook took down the post, it had received more than 2.5 million views and 150,000 shares. There is no Indian law that specifically targets fake news, but police in New Delhi registered a case of forgery against Dandiya and an official said investigations were ongoing. \\r\\nStill, Reuters last week found at least four edited copies of Dandiya’s videos on Facebook with about 36,000 views. One on Google’s YouTube has been seen 2,800 times while another on Twitter has 22,000 views. \\r\\nMessages and e-mails to Dandiya, an avid Facebook user who last appeared in a live video on March 23, went unanswered. The home ministry, the BJP president and party’s information-technology chief did not respond to requests for comment. \\r\\nThe videos underline how social media companies are struggling with fake news in India despite saying they’ve taken steps to tackle the menace ahead of India’s general election, which starts on April 11. \\r\\nWith 900 million people eligible to vote and an estimated half-a-billion with access to the internet, fake news can have an enormous impact on the election. Dandiya’s video, for example, could have seriously damaged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP if enough people thought it was true. \\r\\nPolicing content has become a massive global problem for social media giants which have no template for consistently preventing online fake news or eliminating it. \\r\\nFierce internet disinformation battles gripped countries such as Brazil and Malaysia last year ahead of elections. Authorities in Indonesia and the EU, which are due to hold polls, have warned of the threat of fake news. \\r\\nIn India, Facebook has partnered with fact checkers and, like Twitter, ramped up efforts to block fake accounts. \\r\\nOn Monday, Facebook said it had deleted 1,126 accounts, groups and pages in India and Pakistan for “inauthentic behavior” and spamming, many linked to India’s opposition Congress party. \\r\\nGoogle has partnered with fact-checkers to train 10,000 journalists this year to better tackle fake news. \\r\\nFacebook’s popular messaging app WhatsApp has launched newspaper and radio campaigns to deter the spread of misinformation. \\r\\nSocial media companies say they don’t outrightly remove all fake posts as that would jeopardize free speech. Facebook has said that circulation of posts which are debunked, or discovered to be fake, is reduced by more than 80 percent. \\r\\nNO SILVER BULLET \\r\\nPosts that violate Facebook’s community guidelines, including hate speech or content that could incite violence, are completely deleted, the company said, adding that Dandiya’s video came under that category. \\r\\nBut even when content has been identified as fake and removed, slightly modified versions of the same images, video or text can escape detection and spread further. \\r\\n“This is a highly adversarial space, so we still miss things and won’t catch everything - but we’re making progress,” said a Facebook spokeswoman, who added that the overall volume of false news had been reduced on the platform. \\r\\n“There’s no silver bullet solution in fighting misinformation.” \\r\\nTwitter said it deeply cares about the potentially harmful effects of misinformation and encourages users not\\xa0to share unverified information. \\r\\nA YouTube spokesman said the company will continue to embrace the “democratization of access to information” while providing a reliable service to users. \\r\\nTwitter and YouTube did not comment on Dandiya’s video. \\r\\nSHOWN TO BE FALSE \\r\\nAnother fake post that went viral recently was on popular Indian student leader Kanhaiya Kumar, who was arrested and charged with sedition after a 2016 rally to commemorate the execution of a Kashmiri separatist. Opposition parties said Kumar’s arrest by federal police was an attempt by authorities to curb free speech. \\r\\nSome Facebook posts in February described Kumar as anti-India and showed his photo in front of a map that depicted some Indian states as part of Pakistan. Two Facebook fact-checkers in India investigated the posts and said the image was doctored. \\r\\nStill, a month later, Reuters found at least two copies of those posts on Facebook with 375 comments and 1,500 shares. \\r\\nFacebook in February announced an expansion of its fact-checking company partners to seven, from two. Facebook says it also issues an alert to users who try to share a post which its fact-checkers have debunked, but doesn’t prohibit further sharing. \\r\\nReuters found that when debunked posts of Kumar were shared, an alert popped up with a link to the fact-checkers’ analysis. However, all four variants of Dandiya’s videos could be shared without such fake news alerts from Facebook. \\r\\n“There is no way you can solve this problem (quickly) ... the magnitude of the problem is really huge,” said Kanchan Kaur, a Bengaluru-based assessor at International Fact-Checking Network at U.S.-based Poynter Institute. \\r\\nFACT-CHECKING BUSINESS \\r\\nWhen tensions rose between India and Pakistan in February following a suicide bombing in Kashmir and cross-border air strikes, social media was flooded with fake news - old videos of captured pilots and photos of earthquake-hit regions were spread as depicting current events. \\r\\n“Since Pulwama we’ve been working seven days a week,” said Jency Jacob, managing editor at BOOM, referring to the site of the suicide attack. \\r\\nOn a recent visit to BOOM’s office in India’s financial capital Mumbai, five people were seen monitoring and analyzing online content. One of the rooms served as BOOM’s studio where television-style news videos are shot on debunked stories and published on its website. \\r\\nAs an industry, fact-checking is fast spreading in India. \\r\\nBritish broadcaster BBC has in-house fact checking operations and a dedicated WhatsApp number where anyone can flag suspected fake posts for further checks. \\r\\n“A dedicated team of journalists is debunking fake news daily, and also writing detailed explainers on controversial issues and claims,” BBC’s India Digital Editor, Milind Khandekar, told Reuters. \\r\\nFormer software engineer Pratik Sinha and his mother are part of a 10-member fact checking initiative named “Alt News” which is run from a two-bedroom-flat in the western city of Ahmedabad. \\r\\nUsing online video verification and social media tracking tools, Sinha said his team debunks up to four posts each day. \\r\\nDebunked posts appearing online has become a problem even for India’s Election Commission. \\r\\nIn February, a WhatsApp message called for spreading the word that said Indians living overseas could “now vote online for 2019 elections” and should register on the Commission’s website. The Commission called it “FAKE NEWS” on Twitter and filed a police complaint against “unknown persons” for public mischief. \\r\\nA month later, the message continues to circulate on Facebook - a user who shared it on March 23 has so far received 42 likes and 19 shares. When someone questioned the post, the Facebook user responded: “I think you can vote. Just check the web site and follow the steps”. \\r\\nReporting by Sankalp Phartiyal and Aditya Kalra; Additional reporting by Devjyot Ghoshal and Aditi Shah; Writing by Aditya Kalra; Editing by Martin Howell, Jonathan Weber and Raju Gopalakrishnan.'},\n",

On Earth, geologists use variations in gravity to probe for underground features such as earthquake faults and ore deposits. Wouldnt it be wild if we had something like that on Mars? said Dr. Lewis, the lead author of the Science paper.\\r\\nThen he realized that there were indeed accelerometers on Mars. The Curiosity rover was using such devices to track the tilt of the vehicle as it moved across the surface.\\r\\nThose measurements provided a record of the force of gravity on Curiosity. Luckily, the engineers had already been taking a perfect data set, basically since day one, he said.\\r\\nBecause the sensors were not meant for Dr. Lewiss purpose, the data were quite noisy, he said. The data would jump around pretty severely from day to day.\\r\\nAfter calibrating the measurements and averaging out the variations, the researchers found that gravity indeed waned slightly as Curiosity climbed about 1,000 feet in elevation. But it was less than what would have been measured if Curiosity had been hoisted 1,000 feet into the air. That is because of the additional gravitational attraction from the mass of the mountain.\\r\\nThe change in the force was small. For a person who weighs 150 pounds on Earth (and just 57 pounds on Mars because of the weaker gravity), climbing 1,000 feet up Mount Sharp would shed about one-tenth of an ounce.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'TOKYO (Reuters) - Early in December, dozens of journalists and editors from the Japan Times gathered for an emergency meeting in a glass-walled conference room in their brand-new 14th floor office. \\r\\nOn the agenda was a single, incendiary issue: the newspaper’s new descriptions of how Japan compelled thousands of foreigners into military brothels and labor during World War Two. \\r\\nIn the past, the Japan Times described Korean workers as “forced laborers” and comfort women as those “forced to provide sex for Japanese troops before and during World War II.” \\r\\nBut the five-sentence note published on Nov. 30 said the country’s oldest English-language paper would refer to Korean workers simply as “wartime laborers.” \\r\\nThe paper also said that because of the varied experiences of comfort women, it would describe them as “women who worked in wartime brothels, including those who did so against their will.” \\r\\nSuch terms are social flashpoints in Japan and a topic of bitter dispute with South Korea, whose government argues comfort women were clear victims of wartime abuse. \\r\\nThe changes come amid simmering tensions; South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled in October that Japanese companies must compensate South Koreans forced to work during the war. \\r\\nThe executive editor of the Japan Times, Hiroyasu Mizuno, told staff in the December meeting that he had two goals: to avoid creating the perception the paper was “anti-Japanese,” and to increase advertising revenue from Japanese companies and institutions. \\r\\nSome readers said the change glossed over Japan’s wartime actions. \\r\\nProminent Japanese conservatives, meanwhile, applauded the move, calling it a coup for nationalist activists agitating for English-language news outlets to change such descriptions. \\r\\nIn an email, Mizuno told Reuters he and senior editorial managers decided to revise the paper’s descriptions to “better reflect a more objective view of topics that are both contentious and difficult to summarize.” \\r\\nHe said the Nov. 30 note did not signal a change in the paper’s editorial direction, adding: “I categorically deny any accusations that The Japan Times has bowed to external pressure.” \\r\\nThe Japan Times has an outsized impact on how the country is perceived abroad - it is distributed in Japan with The New York Times - and is seen domestically as an unofficial style guide for other English-language outlets. \\r\\nA New York Times representative said that the editorial operations of the two organizations were separate, and that the paper used precise language on the topic and would continue to do so. \\r\\nReuters interviews with nearly a dozen Japan Times employees - all of whom requested anonymity out of fear of reprisal - along with hundreds of pages of internal emails and presentation materials, show the editorial changes started taking shape when the paper changed hands in June 2017. \\r\\n‘ANTI-JAPANESE’ \\r\\nSome media critics say self-censorship is a problem in Japanese newsrooms, fed by fear of losing access, advertising revenue and subscribers. \\r\\nIn the past, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his top aide, Yoshihide Suga, have singled out the liberal Asahi Shimbun for criticism, including over its articles on comfort women and the Fukushima disaster, some of which it later retracted, citing errors. \\r\\nSuga told Reuters the government would not comment on media companies’ editorial policies, including those of the Japan Times. \\r\\nConservative groups in Japan have pushed hard to change how Japan’s World War Two activities are described. \\r\\nFor instance, an Australian-Japanese organization that protests comfort women statues, saying the monuments feed anti-Japanese sentiment, along with Kent Gilbert, a well-known conservative commentator and lawyer who has worked in Japan for decades, petitioned Asahi Shimbun last year to remove “forced” from its description of comfort women. \\r\\nThe paper did not amend its wording, saying in a public statement that it took care “to use the most appropriate phrasing” for stories. \\r\\nSimilar pressure led the conservative Yomiuri Shimbun to apologize to readers in 2014 for using “sex slaves” to refer to comfort women in its English-language edition. \\r\\n“The Yomiuri Shimbun apologizes for having used these misleading expressions,” the paper’s English site said in a statement at the time. \\r\\nThe chilling effect in newsrooms often comes from within the organization, experts say. \\r\\n“It’s less a result of direct government pressure and more from people inside newsrooms looking to their superiors and the public,” said Minako Beppu, a journalism professor at Hosei University who studies media censorship. “It’s things like, ‘Let’s not criticize them too much,’ or ‘Let’s tone things down a bit.’” \\r\\nAt the Dec. 3 staff meeting, Mizuno said the changes were not political. \\r\\n“I want to get rid of criticism that Japan Times is anti-Japanese,” he said, according to a transcript and audio recording. \\r\\nHe added that the decision would attract advertising. A senior manager in charge of sponsored content then said the paper had already increased government ad sales and scored an exclusive interview with Abe after dropping a column by Jeff Kingston, director of Asia studies at Temple University Japan, who had been writing weekly on what he saw as the Abe administration’s historical revisionism. \\r\\n“From a journalistic standpoint, that’s fatal, really,” a senior Japan Times reporter responded, according to the transcript. \\r\\nA senior South Korean foreign ministry official declined to comment on the Japan Times. \\r\\nIn December, Reuters received a letter from a Japanese government official objecting to the term “sex slave” in a Nov. 22 article about South Korean comfort women. \\r\\nReuters removed the term because the wording breached the agency\\'s stylebook guidance on \"comfort women.\"(here\\r\\nNEW MASTERS \\r\\nFounded in 1897, the Japan Times has a circulation of just 45,000. \\r\\nAfter years of losses and the death of its previous owner, the paper - published under the banner “All the news without fear or favor” - was sold in 2017 to News2u, a PR company. \\r\\nIt’s not unusual in Japan for new management to shift a paper’s editorial stance, and readers may miss subtle changes. \\r\\nBut a few months after the sale, some longtime contributors, including Kingston, were told their regular columns were being cut. \\r\\n“I got an email out of the blue saying, ‘We’re terminating your column,’” Kingston said. \\r\\nMizuno said the paper was open to future submissions from Kingston, but did not say why the column was canceled. \\r\\n“We have retained commentary writers and columnists that are, when appropriate, critical of the Japanese government,” he said in an email. \\r\\nSeveral reporters also said they felt more editorial pressure. \\r\\nIn August 2017, when a local newspaper reported that Tokyo’s governor would snub an annual memorial for Koreans killed by mobs after an earthquake in 1923, reporters rushed to cover the news. But the reporters said they were particularly shocked when, in an email seen by Reuters, Mizuno told staff, “I think there is absolutely no value for us to report on this.” \\r\\nA SWIFT CHANGE \\r\\nA few months after the paper’s exclusive sit-down with Abe in February, Mizuno tried to revise the paper’s style on comfort women and other sensitive topics, presenting editors with more than 100 meticulously annotated articles and columns. \\r\\nIn the notes, seen by Reuters, Mizuno objected to calling comfort women “victims” or mentioning that they included girls; questioned referring to Japan’s occupation of Korea as “brutal”; and criticized the paper’s reporting and stories by wire services, including Reuters, as generally “pro-Korea” and not adequately reflecting Japan’s view. \\r\\n“We’re not historians or arbiters of history, nor are we judges,” he wrote. \\r\\nUltimately, he failed to persuade others, and the matter was put on hold. \\r\\nBut the South Korean court ruling in October led to a swift denunciation from the Japanese government and a flurry of coverage. \\r\\nMizuno turned to senior managers and the board of directors to make broader changes, according to Japan Times employees. \\r\\nAround the same time, the ultra-conservative think tank Japan Institute for National Fundamentals called on English-language media and specifically the Japan Times to refer to plaintiffs in the Seoul case as “wartime Korean workers,” leaving out references to coercion. \\r\\nTwo weeks later, the editor’s note appeared in the Japan Times. \\r\\nReporting by Mari Saito and Ami Miyazaki; Additional reporting by Hyonhee Shin in Seoul; Editing by Gerry Doyle'},\n",

       "  'content': 'LONDON (Reuters) - Yannis Behrakis, one of Reuters’ most decorated and best-loved photographers, has died after a long battle with cancer. He was 58. \\r\\nAfter joining the news wire 30 years ago, Behrakis covered many of the most tumultuous events around the world, including conflicts in Afghanistan and Chechnya, a huge earthquake in Kashmir and the Egyptian uprising of 2011. \\r\\nIn the process, he won the respect of both peers and rivals for his skill and bravery. He also led a team to a Pulitzer Prize in 2016 for coverage of the refugee crisis. \\r\\nColleagues who worked with him in the field said Reuters had lost a talented and committed journalist. \\r\\n“It is about clearly telling the story in the most artistic way possible,” veteran Reuters photographer Goran Tomasevic said of Behrakis’ style. \\r\\n“You won’t see anyone so dedicated and so focused and who sacrificed everything to get the most important picture.” \\r\\nThat dedication was striking. His friend and colleague of 30 years, senior producer Vassilis Triandafyllou, described him as a “hurricane” who worked all hours of the day and night, sometimes at considerable personal risk, to get the image he wanted. \\r\\nWhen Behrakis wasn’t absorbed in work, he was warm, funny and larger than life. He could also be fiery. \\r\\n“One of the best news photographers of his generation, Yannis was passionate, vital and intense both in his work and life,” said U.S. general news editor Dina Kyriakidou Contini. \\r\\n“His pictures are iconic, some works of art in their own right. But it was his empathy that made him a great photojournalist.” \\r\\nWhat underpinned everything Behrakis did in his professional life was a determination to show the world what was happening in conflict zones and countries in crisis. \\r\\nHe recognized the power of an arresting image to capture people’s attention and even change their behavior. That belief produced a body of work that will be remembered long after his passing. \\r\\n“My mission is to tell you the story and then you decide what you want to do,” he told a panel discussing Reuters Pulitzer Prize-winning photo series on the European migrant crisis. \\r\\n“My mission is to make sure that nobody can say: ‘I didn’t know’.” \\r\\n“UNDER FIRE” \\r\\nBehrakis was born in Athens in 1960. \\r\\nHe came across a Time-Life photography book as a young man, which prompted him to enroll in a private photography course. His love affair with the trade had begun. \\r\\nHe worked in a photographic studio in the mid-1980s, but found the atmosphere stifling. \\r\\nIt was a 1983 movie, “Under Fire”, about a group of reporters working in Nicaragua in the days leading to the 1979 revolution, that inspired him to take up journalism. \\r\\nHe started at Reuters in Athens as a freelancer in 1987, and in January, 1989, was sent on his first foreign assignment to Muammar Gaddafi’s Libya. \\r\\nHe quickly displayed a knack for being in the right place at the right time. \\r\\nWhen Gaddafi visited a hotel where journalists had been cooped up for several days, a scrum of reporters crowded around the Libyan leader to get pictures and soundbites. \\r\\n“I somehow managed to sneak next to him and get some wide-angle shots,” Behrakis wrote. “The next day my picture was all over the front pages of papers around the world.” \\r\\nCONFLICTS AND DANGER \\r\\nFor the next three decades, Behrakis was regularly on the road covering violence and upheaval across Europe, Russia, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. \\r\\nThe pictures he produced won awards and admiration among the tight-knit community of war correspondents, who noted his rare ability to find beauty amid chaos and for his courage to be at the heart of the action. \\r\\nThe images reut.rs/2IIte65 captured the terror of battle, fear, death, love, intimidation, starvation, homelessness, anger, despair and courage. \\r\\nOne photograph from the wars in former Yugoslavia, taken in 1998, shows an ethnic Albanian man lowering the body of a two-year-old boy who had been killed in the fighting into a tiny coffin. \\r\\nBehrakis took the picture from a high position and used a slow speed/zoom technique to create a dizzying sense of movement. \\r\\n“The picture was very strong and the body of the boy almost floating in the air,” he said of the image. “It almost looked like his spirit was leaving his body for the heavens.” \\r\\nIn 2000, while covering the civil war in Sierra Leone, Behrakis was traveling in a convoy with Reuters colleagues Kurt Schork and Mark Chisholm, and AP cameraman Miguel Gil Moreno, when it was ambushed by gunmen, believed to be rebels. \\r\\nSchork, one of Behrakis’ closest friends, was hit and died instantly, and Moreno was also killed. Behrakis and Chisholm escaped. \\r\\nBoth survived the attack by crawling into the undergrowth beside the road and hiding in the jungle for hours until the gunmen disappeared. \\r\\nBehrakis took a photo of himself just after the ordeal. The picture shows him staring up at the sky, his eyes dazed. \\r\\n“I think that changed Yannis a lot,” Chisholm said of the attack and Schork’s death. The four reporters had got to know each other during the siege of Sarajevo in the mid-1990s and had become a “band of brothers”. \\r\\n“He was a great character, a brilliant photographer, a great colleague,” Chisholm said. \\r\\nBehrakis said he hated war, but, like many others, he loved the travel, adventure and camaraderie that came with it. Rather than putting him off, Schork’s death drove him back to combat zones, at least for a while. \\r\\n“His memory helped me to ‘return’ to covering what I consider the apotheosis of photojournalism: war photography,” Behrakis wrote. \\r\\nHOMECOMING \\r\\nIn recent years, Behrakis spent more time in his native Greece, where he recorded the impact of the financial crisis on the country and the influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees entering Europe. \\r\\nIn 2015, Behrakis and a team of photographers and cameramen worked in relay for months to cover the thousands fleeing wars in Syria, Afghanistan and beyond. \\r\\nHe took a younger and less experienced photographer, Alkis Konstantinidis, under his wing at that time and the two became close. \\r\\nKonstantinidis, also part of the Pulitzer Prize-winning team, described Behrakis as a tough, demanding mentor who led by example. \\r\\n“When you get close to him and he opens up, he is a person you want to sit next to and talk to for hours. You will always get something from him.” \\r\\nFor a proud Greek with a young daughter, the refugee crisis had a profound effect on Behrakis, causing guilt, insomnia and nightmares. \\r\\nBut it also brought out the best in a photographer who focused on the dignity of humans in distress rather than making them objects of pity. \\r\\nTriandafyllou was with Behrakis when he took what many consider to be one of his best pictures - of a Syrian refugee carrying and kissing his daughter as he walked down a road in the rain. \\r\\n“That morning we left the hotel and it was raining and Yannis was complaining,” Triandafyllou recalled. \\r\\n“On the way to the border we saw these refugees and he started taking pictures. After a while I said ‘OK, let’s go’. He said ‘No, no, wait, I don’t have the picture.’ I was waiting in the car and he eventually came back and said ‘OK, I have the picture.’ He was looking for this picture.” \\r\\nBehrakis’ description of the image was typically unorthodox. \\r\\n“I would love to be this father; I think every child would love to have a father like this,” he explained. \\r\\n“This picture proves that there are superheroes after all. He doesn’t wear a red cape, but he has a black plastic cape made out of garbage bags. For me this represents the universal father and the unconditional love of father to daughter.” \\r\\nIn 2017, Yannis launched a project to help Reuters build a more diverse team of news photographers. \\r\\nHis appearances at photo festivals and events around the world inspired many young journalists to apply for a bursary from Reuters. He was very proud of this work, and was still looking for a new generation of talent right up until his death. \\r\\nBehrakis is survived by his wife Elisavet and their daughter Rebecca and his son Dimitri. \\r\\nReporting and writing by Mike Collett-White; Editing by Simon Robinson'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Recent storms may have ended California\\'s drought when it comes to water, but not when it comes to earthquakes, scientists say. The Golden State is in the midst of an earthquake drought. Seismologists are saying there haven\\'t been enough powerful earthquakes in the past 100 years along California\\'s highest slip-rate faults, and a ground-rupturing quake with a magnitude greater than 7.0 is overdue, CBS San Francisco reports. \\r\\nA new study coming out Wednesday in the\\xa0Seismological Research Letters\\xa0says California\\'s current earthquake drought is unlike any other paleoseismic period in the last 1,000 years. The aim of the study, titled, \"The Current Unlikely Hiatus at California\\'s Transform Boundary Paleoseismic Sites,\" points to the unlikelihood of the last hundred years of relative seismic silence. \\r\\nResearchers at the U.S. Geological Survey analyzed data from the San Andreas, San Jacinto, Elsinore and Hayward faults as well as identified eight ground-rupturing quakes between 1800 and 1918. Those include a devastating quake in 1906 in San Francisco with an estimated magnitude of 7.9, and a similar earthquake in 1857 in Southern California. \\r\\nThere have been no quakes comparable in size since 1918, and the study says the current hiatus is \"exceptional.\" \\r\\n\"If our work is correct, the next century isn\\'t going to be like the last one, but could be more like the century that ended in 1918,\" said lead researcher Glenn Biasi. \"We know these big faults have to carry most of the [tectonic] motion in California, and sooner or later they have to slip. The only questions are how they\\'re going to let go and when.\" \\r\\nTerrifying earthquakes in modern history21 photos\\r\\nSince the earthquake of 1906 destroyed much of San Francisco, there have been only three quakes magnitude six or higher, including Loma Prieta in 1989, CBS Sacramento reports. But in the 1800s, there were 14 big quakes. \\r\\nThe Hayward fault, which runs through most of the East Bay, concerns Angela Chung at the the University of California, Berkeley\\'s Seismology Lab. It\\'s one reason she helped develop an alert system that sends warnings to your cellphone. It was tested in Oakland last week. \\r\\n\"We can\\'t predict earthquakes what we can do is let you know when quake strikes, you\\'re about to feel the shaking,\" she said. \\r\\nBerkeley structural Engineer Thor Matteson, is seeing a six-month backlog of people wanting to seismically retrofit their houses. \"What we\\'re looking to do is keep you in your house and out of tent city,\" said Matteson. \\r\\nExperts urge everyone to be quake ready.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Recent storms may have ended California\\'s drought when it comes to water, but not when it comes to quakes, according to scientists. The state is in the midst of an earthquake drought.\\r\\nSeismologists are saying there haven\\'t been enough powerful earthquakes in the past 100 years along California\\'s highest slip-rate faults, and a ground-rupturing quake with a magnitude greater than 7.0 is overdue, CBS SF Bay Area reports.\\r\\nA new study coming out Wednesday in the\\xa0Seismological Research Letters\\xa0says California\\'s current earthquake drought is unlike any other paleoseismic period in the last 1,000 years. The aim of the study, titled, \"The Current Unlikely Hiatus at California\\'s Transform Boundary Paleoseismic Sites,\" points to the unlikelihood of the last hundred years of relative seismic silence.\\r\\nResearchers at the U.S. Geological Survey analyzed data from the San Andreas, San Jacinto, Elsinore and Hayward faults as well as identified eight ground-rupturing quakes between 1800 and 1918. Those include a devastating quake in 1906 in San Francisco with an estimated magnitude of 7.9, and a similar earthquake in 1857 in Southern California.\\xa0\\r\\nThere have been no quakes comparable in size since 1918, and the study says the current hiatus is \"exceptional.\"\\r\\n\"If our work is correct, the next century isn\\'t going to be like the last one, but could be more like the century that ended in 1918,\" said lead researcher Glenn Biasi. \"We know these big faults have to carry most of the [tectonic] motion in California, and sooner or later they have to slip. The only questions are how they\\'re going to let go and when.\"\\r\\nSince the earthquake of 1906 destroyed much of San Francisco, there have been only three quakes magnitude six or higher, including Loma Prieta in 1989, CBS Sacramento reports. But in the 1800s, there were 14 big quakes.\\r\\nThe Hayward fault, which runs through most of the East Bay, concerns Angela Chung at the the University of California, Berkeley\\'s Seismology Lab. It\\'s one reason she helped develop an alert system that sends warnings to your cellphone. It was tested in Oakland last week.\\r\\n\"We can\\'t predict earthquakes what we can do is let you know when quake strikes, you\\'re about to feel the shaking,\" she said.\\r\\nBerkeley structural Engineer Thor Matteson, is seeing a six-month backlog of people wanting to seismically retrofit their houses. \"What we\\'re looking to do is keep you in your house and out of tent city,\" said Matteson.\\r\\nExperts urge everyone to be quake ready.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Rooms from 53,000 pesos (or about $80 at current exchange rates).\\r\\nIn Chile, Santiagos rakish sailor brother is the port city of Valparaíso, with its handsome looks, edgy creativity and whiff of salt-air decay. Valpo, as residents call it, was entirely rebuilt after an earthquake in 1906. Its present mix of crumbling Victorian stone facades and sharp-edged, galvanized-metal shacks are splashed with colorful paint and arresting graffiti. They clamber up from a wide Pacific bay and ramble across some 40 hills. Although design-forward shipping container hotels have been popping up worldwide lately, the Valparaíso winemaker Grant Phelps lays claim to being the first to build with them in this historic port. Mr. Phelps stacked 25 decommissioned containers like blocks to create 21 graffitied guest rooms. He also created jutting private balconies and two decadent terraces that beg for adult beverages (children under 12 arent allowed at the hotel). The WineBox Valparaíso opened in February 2018 as sustainable lodging with attitude. Its also an urban winery Mr. Phelps, and often his guests, crush grapes and monitor aging barrels of wine in the parking garage.\\r\\nMost visitors wander a couple of Valpos most colorful hills, Cerro Alegre and Cerro Bellavista, which vibrate with both clever graffiti and multistory street-art murals. The WineBox opens an adjacent hill, the previously residential Cerro Mariposa, to tourism. The hotel is still a quick, if gradually sloping, walk to the most Instagram-ready sights especially the late Chilean poet Pablo Nerudas fanciful Valparaíso home, La Sebastiana, rising like a ships prow from Bellavista. Valparaísos former prison, now the Parque Cultural, is about a mile away. Restaurants, as I found during a recent solo visit, remain a bit scarce in the immediate area.\\r\\nThe WineBoxs environmentalism is also evident in the rooms. They were insulated with projected cellulose, a material that includes recycled newspaper, from the noise Id expected inside a metal shipping container. Even so, turndown service included earplugs (as well as dulce de leche candy). The container kept its original long-rectangle shape, but felt bright and open, the far end a glass door leading to a deep balcony. Binoculars were provided for scoping the hillsides and port. Recycled pallets had been crafted into a bed, which felt cozy as a ships berth. The room also held a kitchenette, which was stocked with not only salt and pepper, but also Chiles favorite smoked pepper, merkén. The wine-only minibar offered a selection of five reds, two whites and a sparkling (from 9,000 to 19,000 pesos, or about $13.25 to about $28), all Chilean wines from independent vintners.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Mr. Baptie said that the British rules had been set at very, very conservative levels. As more data becomes available, he said, there could be scope for modifying the thresholds to perhaps a limit of 1.0. He warned, though, that increasing the amounts of liquids injected might also increase the probability of larger seismic events. In western Canada, for instance, fracking was blamed for a substantial 4.8-magnitude earthquake in 2016.\\r\\nStill, the fact that any tremors were recorded may prove a setback for the industry. It has demonstrated quite clearly that they cannot undertake the fracking process without causing earthquakes, said Miranda Cox, a local councilor in Kirkham, which is about three miles from the site, and an opponent of fracking.\\r\\nStudies have shown that Britain has substantial natural gas resources embedded in shale rock, but Cuadrillas recent experiment appears to leave both the government and the industry with few attractive options. For the government, fracking offers the potential to enhance Britains energy security by providing an alternative to imported fuel, but it will be reluctant to be seen easing regulations in a way that increases risks.\\r\\nFor the handful of active shale companies, progress has been slow, stymied by a lengthy regulatory process and opposition from environmentalists and local residents who worry about earthquakes and groundwater pollution. Those living near potential drilling sites also do not want their lives disrupted by the large volumes of truck traffic that drilling and fracking a well require.\\r\\nIn Lancashire, a small but determined band of protesters has monitored and occasionally obstructed drilling. According to the Lancashire police, about 100 officers were involved in patrolling the Cuadrilla site from January 2017 through September 2018 with cumulative costs exceeding 9 million pounds.\\r\\nIn an interview in October before drilling began, Mr. Egan, Cuadrillas chief executive, suggested that the protests and other obstacles might melt away once the industry gained traction.\\r\\nThat seems unlikely to happen soon given the recent experience.\\r\\nRichard Taylor, an oil and gas analyst at Fitch Solutions, a market research firm, said the tremors had done no favors for the fledgling industry.\\r\\nIt reaffirms our long-term view that production from shale gas in the U.K. at a commercial stage is very much a distant prospect, he said.'},\n",

After Laura begins to receive psychic warnings that Jacko may be in danger, a strange old man (played by a deliciously unnerving Timothy Spall) develops an intense interest in the boy.

       "  'content': 'ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish government amnesty on unregistered construction work is endangering lives, engineers and architects warned after an illegally extended residential building collapsed in Istanbul and killed 21 people. \\r\\nThree floors of the eight-story building had been built illegally, but owners of the property were able to register it under the amnesty that has brought in billions of dollars of revenue for the government. \\r\\nExperts say the ruins of the building, which crumpled two weeks ago in Istanbul’s Asian district of Kartal, highlight the dangers of approving unregulated construction work in a city of 15 million people that is prone to earthquakes. \\r\\nSome work has started to address safety concerns, but they say it is concentrated in wealthier neighborhoods, rather than highest risk areas, and the amnesty has exacerbated the peril. \\r\\n“It will mean transforming our cities, notably Istanbul, into graveyards and result in coffins emerging from our homes,” said Cemal Gokce, the chairman of the Chamber of Civil Engineers. \\r\\n“Whether it is completely unlicensed, or has more floors than the original plan, they gave an amnesty to all buildings. This is very dangerous,” he said. \\r\\nSome 10 million people applied to benefit from the amnesty and 1.8 million of the applications were accepted. \\r\\nProperty owners pay to register the buildings, which are then subject to various taxes and levies. The amnesty had brought 16.5 billion lira ($3.1 billion) in property taxes and registration fees into government coffers, the urbanization minister said in December. \\r\\nHis ministry did not respond to Reuters questions about criticism of the property amnesty, which was set to expire at the end of 2018 but has been extended until June. \\r\\nThe government says it was needed to remove disagreements between the state and citizens, as well as to “give legality to these structures by registering them”. \\r\\nPAYING WITH LIVES \\r\\nIstanbul Chamber of Architects head Esin Koymen said the chamber had warned the government about the consequences of the amnesty bill when it was debated in parliament. \\r\\n“We told them to withdraw it. We said people will pay for this with their lives. But they did not listen,” she said, adding that the focus had been on the revenues it would generate rather than architectural, planning or engineering issues. \\r\\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan’s AK Party has put great emphasis on construction, which has helped drive growth during its 16 years in power. \\r\\nBut more than half of Turkey’s building stock, or 13 million buildings, contravenes housing regulations, according to Environment and Urbanisation Ministry data, and many Istanbul residents worry about potential damage from a major earthquake. \\r\\nA quake in the Izmit region, some 70 km (45 miles) east of the city, killed more than 17,000 people in August 1999. \\r\\nErdogan said on Saturday he was “scared” by the prospect of another big earthquake. In an interview with CNN Turk, he blamed the Istanbul building collapse on illegal construction, which he said constituted a threat in all major cities. \\r\\nAccording to figures from TSKB Real Estate Appraiser general manager Makbule Yonel Maya, around 32 percent of buildings in Turkey since 2002 were not built in line with legal regulations. \\r\\nWriting by Ece Toksabay; Editing by Daren Butler and Alison Williams'},\n",

       "  'content': 'SEATTLE Years after the highway teardown movement helped reshape places like Boston and Seoul, this Pacific Northwest city is in the midst of a similar transformation. \\r\\nOn Monday, the nations first double-decker traffic tunnel will open here, reaching more than 200 feet at its lowest point below the citys congested streets.\\r\\nThe two-mile deep-bore tunnel is replacing the Alaskan Way Viaduct, an unsightly, earthquake-damaged elevated highway that runs along the citys picturesque waterfront.\\r\\nLeaders and planners had long derided the hulking concrete eyesore that separates popular waterfront attractions such as the Seattle Aquarium and Washington State Ferries from iconic landmarks, including Pike Place Market and the Seattle Art Museum.\\r\\nNow the viaducts celebrated replacement, 18 years after the Nisqually earthquake nearly brought it down, is expected not only to reorient the citys expanding skyline but finally merge its downtown with its tourist-heavy waterfront.\\r\\nEight acres of new public parks, with a landscaped promenade and space for cycling and recreation, will emerge along 26 blocks from what is now the highways shadows.\\r\\nWhen we started studying options for the viaduct replacement we looked at the Embarcadero in San Francisco and understood what a great benefit opening up the waterfront to the public and having better access was going to be, said Paula J. Hammond, senior vice president at WSP USA, a multinational engineering and design firm.\\r\\nHammond spent 35 years with the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and was transportation secretary during the early years of planning for the viaduct replacement. I think in the end, it will be just like in Boston, where visitors and residents walk along the Greenway and no one remembers all the haggling that went on, Hammond said. They love that corridor, and they love the parks and the open space, and think it was smartest thing Boston ever did.\\r\\nThe new Highway 99 tunnel stretches from the industrial tangle south of downtown, near one of the West Coasts biggest seaports and two major stadiums, north to where the late Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Paul Allen over the past decade transformed a sleepy neighborhood into a vibrant commercial and residential corridor, now anchored by Amazon. It is the longest road tunnel in the contiguous United States, it will carry traffic along two lanes in each direction on two levels, with a posted speed limit of 45 mph.\\r\\nThe $3.3 billion viaduct replacement is among a number of big-ticket transportation projects that will shift the way people and freight move around the region. Among them is an extension of the regions light-rail system running north of Seattle and another east across the Interstate 90 floating bridge to connect high-tech suburbs across Lake Washington.\\r\\nThe project is similar to how Marylands light-rail Purple Line and phase two of the Metro Silver Line extension into Loudoun County will fill gaps in the Washington regions transportation network\\r\\nWashington state permanently closed the viaduct Jan. 11, sending 90,000 vehicles a day scrambling for alternative routes. Demolition will begin shortly after the tunnel opens.\\r\\nBuilt during the freeway construction frenzy of the 1950s as one of two north-south corridors through Seattle, the viaduct is part of State Route 99, a patchwork of surface streets, freeway segments and the 3,000-foot Battery Street tunnel.\\r\\nHomeless residents in tents and sleeping bags find shelter in its gritty underbelly, between the six-story concrete columns and parking lots.\\r\\nMehran Sepehr, a business consultant who used to take the viaduct to his downtown offices multiple days a week, said he will miss the view it afforded from the top the downtown skyline to the east and the expanse of Puget Sound to the west and the Olympic Mountains beyond.\\r\\nI think for Seattle to be a truly great city, the viaduct had to come down, said Sepehr, who moved to Seattle in 2001, the year the Nisqually earthquake hit. This citys relationship with the water is one of its defining characteristics, and removing that artificial barrier between downtown and the waterfront will open up a whole new avenue for this city.\\r\\nAmong those like him who used to drive nervously across the viaducts weathered frame, residents living within earshot of its unrelenting din and confused visitors negotiating its Gotham City-like underside, there are few tears being shed over the viaducts demise.\\r\\nYet deciding how to replace the downtown highway embroiled this city in more than a decade of political drama, myriad citizen forums and stakeholder groups, three advisory ballot measures and an embarrassing two-year stall by a storied tunnel-drilling machine called Bertha. Throughout the process, every mayor and mayoral candidate in Seattle staked out a position on replacing the viaduct and about 90 replacement proposals were put forth before then-Gov. Christine Gregoire (D) put an end to it in 2009, announcing that the tunnel would be her pick. By then, the state had spent more than $325 million.\\r\\nThis is not just about replacing a road, Gregoire said at a January 2009 news conference. This is about building a 21st-century city.\\r\\nHer motivation was safety, Gregoire said recently. I knew it was just a matter of time before Mother Nature took down both the viaduct and the 520 bridge, she said, referring to one of two floating bridges across Lake Washington.\\r\\nInitially, Gregoire and state transportation planners were against a deep-bore tunnel option as irresponsible and too expensive. But as the political debate raged, pressure from interest groups mounted and technology brought the cost of a tunnel within a budget officials thought was manageable.\\r\\nGregoire recalls sitting down for dinner with former British Columbia premier Gordon Campbell, who, looking out toward Elliott Bay, spotted the viaduct and inquired, What is that monstrosity?\\r\\nIn replacing it, she said, Well create an iconic waterfront, and everyone will look back and wonder what was wrong with us. Why didnt we do this a long time ago?\\r\\nNot everyone.\\r\\nFormer Seattle mayor Michael McGinn (D), who won office in 2009 campaigning against the tunnel, continues to believe the state made the wrong choice.\\r\\nMcGinn was among a group of environmentalists who favored what he said was the more climate-conscious option of expanding transit and improving surrounding streets and nearby Interstate 5 to handle spillover traffic.\\r\\nMcGinn points to San Franciscos Embarcadero Freeway and the New Yorks West Side Highway as successful examples of deteriorating highways that were demolished and not replaced and not missed.\\r\\nThis is the new face of climate change denialism and it runs deep in both political parties, McGinn said.\\r\\nIncreasingly, states and the federal government will be forced to make these kinds of transportation decisions, the former mayor said. Do we continue doubling down and expanding the highway infrastructure, or do we, when the time comes, transition to transit, biking and walking as well as walkable communities?\\r\\nSo Im not sure what we are celebrating here, McGinn said.\\r\\nThe viaduct replacement has frequently invited comparisons to Bostons infamous Big Dig, the rerouting of that citys elevated downtown highway into an underground tunnel that was plagued by design flaws, enormous cost overruns and delays.\\r\\nThe comparisons dogged Washington transportation officials, who early on had visited Boston and other cities to learn what went well and what did not.\\r\\nThe state chose a design-build contract for the viaduct project, meaning the contractor, Seattle Tunnel Partners, was given creative freedom but would share in the risk of the project, which is three years behind schedule, including the two years Bertha was idle. The states $3.3 billion budget, almost two-thirds of it from state gas-tax revenue, includes the demolition of the viaduct; rebuilding streets at the tunnels portal and a portion of the major rebuild; and expansion of Alaskan Way, the street along the waterfront and beneath the viaduct. (Meanwhile, contractors have sued for up to $600 million to cover delays and repairs associated with Berthas breakdown.)\\r\\nBeginning midyear, the tunnel will have variable-rate tolls meaning they will fluctuate depending on the time of day ranging from $1 to $2.25.\\r\\nDesigned with fire suppression and air monitoring and ventilation to measure and reduce the levels of vehicle emissions, the Highway 99 tunnel was built to withstand a 9.0-magnitude earthquake (which occur every 2,500 years, on average). A 24-hour tunnel control center will have direct lines to emergency responders.\\r\\nFrom the window of his antique store, which he has run for the past 40 years, Ken Eubank can see beyond the columns of the viaduct to a waterfront park, the Seattle Great Wheel and out toward Elliott Bay and Puget Sound.\\r\\nHis Seattle Antiques Market, wedged between a storage business and Seattles only dedicated blues club, which closed on New Years Day, is among the warehouses and small businesses operating in the shadow of the viaduct.\\r\\nAnd while, like most, he is not sorry to see the viaduct go, its removal leaves him and other nearby business owners with something of a quandary. Eubank said he will probably mothball his store during the months of demolition this spring, and he has not decided whether he will reopen.\\r\\nMy business plan is really good, Eubank jokes. My exit plan is terrible.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Chinese artist Ai Weiwei unveiled a new installation in Mexico that tells the story of 43 students likely massacred five years ago in a case that exposed government stonewalling and complicity in abuses, a frequent theme for the dissident artist. \\r\\nThe installation features large portraits of the students made from a million multi-colored Legos that hover above a cavernous exhibit space, images that have become seared into the Mexican conscience by grieving family members who often hoist posters with the same images at protests demanding answers for their sons’ disappearance. \\r\\nEntitled “Reestablishing Memories,” the work also features a timeline of the 2014 abduction of the trainee-teachers from the all-boys Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers College in southern Mexico and the government’s widely disparaged investigation into the case. \\r\\n“Why do we have to do it? Because every crime creates a vacuum and it poisons society,” Ai told reporters at a news conference on Thursday. \\r\\nKnown for his criticism of Communist-run China’s stifling of free expression, Ai said his latest project was partially inspired by the Chinese government’s refusal to explain its errors following a massive 2008 earthquake in Sichuan in which thousands of students died in government-built schools. \\r\\n“It reminded me of the Mexicans who lost their children,” he said, explaining how his own search for answers following the tragedy was stymied. \\r\\nAn initial Mexican government investigation found that the Ayotzinapa students were abducted by corrupt police who handed them over to a local drug gang. The gang then killed them for reasons that remain unclear and burnt their bodies in a trash dump, discarding the ashes into a nearby river, it concluded. \\r\\nBut the account was tainted by allegations of torture and the possible involvement of soldiers. \\r\\nTo date, the remains of just one student have been identified. \\r\\nAi, who was detained by the Chinese government in 2011 and currently lives in Berlin, supervised the creation of the oversized Lego portraits by students from Mexico’s National Autonomous University (UNAM). \\r\\nLast year, Ai accused Lego of refusing to directly sell its interlocking plastic toy bricks to him. \\r\\nThe Danish company said its policy was designed to keep it out of politics, but later reversed its stand in the face of a public backlash. \\r\\n“Reestablishing Memories,” which is paired with Ai’s earlier “Wang Family Ancestral Hall” installation, opens on Saturday on the UNAM campus in Mexico City, and will be on display through October. \\r\\nReporting by Alberto Fajardo; Writing by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Sandra Maler'},\n",

It cited experts as saying the earthquakes might have occurred due to natural causes, “but they could not rule out industrial mining”. \\r\\n“Due to safety reasons and requirements on safe production, shale gas mining companies have suspended mining work,” it quoted the county government as saying. \\r\\nThe state-run Global Times said five quakes had hit the area since January including two on Monday above magnitude 4, prompting “some residents” to gather outside the government’s offices to call for a halt to shale gas exploitation. \\r\\nThe newspaper cited video footage on social media showing more than 1,000 people attempting to topple the gate of the government building with some 100 police trying to keep the gate upright. Reuters has not independently verified the footage. \\r\\n“Some residents came this afternoon after the earthquake, and now they have calmed down and left.

       "  'content': '(CNN)The unprecedented attacks on two mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch, in which at least 49 people died and 20 were seriously injured, have left a peaceful nation reeling. \\r\\nBut this is not the first time the coastal city of around 400,000 people on New Zealand\\'s South Island has been swept by tragedy. \\r\\nBetween 2010 and 2011, the country\\'s third most populous city was plagued by a series of earthquakes. \\r\\nThe worst happened in February 2011, when a 6.3-magnitude earthquake ripped through Christchurch in the middle of the day -- toppling buildings onto buses, buckling streets and damaging cathedrals.\\r\\nWhile New Zealand is accustomed to earthquakes, few have been as devastating as that tremor, which killed 185 people, injured 6,000 and damaged 170,000 buildings. \\r\\nThe bulk of the deaths occurred when a six-story office block, the CTV Building, collapsed during the quake. \\r\\nAccording to official figures, 115 people were killed in the CTV Building, 18 people died in the PGC office building, eight people died on buses and 28 people died elsewhere in central Christchurch, while 12 victims were in suburban locations. Another four deaths were found to be directly associated with the incident.\\r\\nThe victims came from numerous countries across globe and included a group of students learning English in the CTV Building. \\r\\nWitness Gavin Blowman told CNN at the time that he ran to the street when the earthquake struck.\\r\\n\"It felt like I was running on jelly,\" he said. \"We saw a giant rock tumble to the ground from a cliff -- a rock that had been there for millennia. It fell on the RSA (veterans\\' association) building -- it was terrifying.\"\\r\\nLaura Campbell told CNN she was at work when the earthquake struck. She described seeing \"windows blowing out, bricks falling down, people screaming, the whole nine yards.\"\\r\\nThe earthquake caused soft sand and silt to liquefy, which led to ruptured water and sewer pipes, shattered roads and wrecked buildings. It caused cliffs to collapse and dislodged boulders. \\r\\nThe widespread damage cost the country an estimated NZ$20 billion ($13.7 billion) according to New Zealand\\'s government, and the city\\'s retail, hospitality and accommodation sectors were hit the hardest. \\r\\nAs of January 2019, the country\\'s earthquake commission is still dealing with 2,233 claims from the quake. \\r\\nAccording to the city council, the tremors \"had an immediate effect on Christchurch City\\'s population, with an estimated 20,000 leaving the city in the first two years.\"\\r\\nThe psychological toll of the earthquake quickly became apparent. In 2012, a study by the Canterbury District Health Board and the Mental Health Foundation found that more that 80% involved in the study said their lives had changed \"significantly\" since the event. More than two-thirds of people asked said they were \"grieving for lost Christchurch.\"\\r\\nAnother study found that heart attacks spiked a year after the earthquakes. \\r\\nAccording to Reuters, the residents of the most-damaged areas were 22% more likely to be admitted to hospitals for heart attacks than their neighbors in the least-damaged areas. \\r\\n\"Our study suggests it\\'s not just the shaking people experience, but the long-term impacts on their lives, if they lose their homes,\" one of the study\\'s authors, Vicky Cameron, told Reuters.'},\n",

The Highlanders had been expecting a crowd of 20,000. \\r\\n“This is always the biggest fixture on our match calendar and one which our fans look forward to,” Clark said. \\r\\n“But when we think about the massive loss of life and absolute devastation that has been wreaked on people in Christchurch, we feel this is the right decision.” \\r\\nSECOND CANCELLATION \\r\\nThe match is the second cancellation of a high-profile sporting event with the third cricket test between New Zealand and Bangladesh called off on Friday. It had been scheduled to begin in Christchurch on Saturday. \\r\\nMembers of the Bangladesh team narrowly avoided being caught up in the shooting at the Al Noor mosque when they arrived for Friday prayers. \\r\\nPolice have said 41 people were killed at the mosque, while seven others died at the Linwood mosque. One more died in hospital later. \\r\\nIt is the second time in the last decade that a Crusaders match in Super Rugby has been canceled. \\r\\nTheir clash with the Wellington Hurricanes in late February 2011 was scratched after the devastating earthquake that flattened much of central Christchurch and killed almost 200 people. \\r\\nThat match was deemed a draw and both teams awarded two points by governing body SANZAAR. \\r\\nA NZR spokesperson said the decision on the points for Saturday’s game would be made by SANZAAR, who were not immediately available for comment. \\r\\nThe Super Rugby match between the Waikato Chiefs and Wellington Hurricanes in Hamilton on Friday went ahead, although players and the crowd observed a minute’s silence before kickoff. \\r\\nThere was also a minute’s silence before the ACT Brumbies match with the New South Wales Waratahs in Canberra, and at the National Rugby League match between Sydney Roosters and South Sydney Rabbitohs at Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday evening. \\r\\nReporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Nick Mulvenney'},\n",

       "  'content': 'NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - A top Myanmar investment official on Tuesday suggested alternatives such as scaling back or relocating a stalled Chinese-backed dam project that has strained ties between the neighbors. \\r\\nMyanmar angered China in 2011 when its former quasi-civilian government suspended the $3.6 billion Myitsone hydro-power dam in the country’s north amid environmental concerns. \\r\\nAsked about the dam at an investment conference, Thaung Tun, chairman of Myanmar’s investment commission, listed several problems, from an earthquake fault line running under the project site to a large catchment area affecting residents. \\r\\n“Catchment area would be twice the size of Singapore. This would mean that a lot of villages will have been displaced from their accessible land. That is the issue,” Thaung Tun told reporters at the conference in the capital Naypyitaw. \\r\\nThaung Tun listed several alternatives, including scaling back the dam, moving it to a different location, or offering the operator an alternative project. He did not say if the government had a preferred option. \\r\\nMyanmar had to consider its relations with China, its largest trade partner, and “was working hard to find the solution,” he said. \\r\\nSpearheading these efforts is a commission launched by Aung San Suu Kyi’s government, which came to power in 2016, to review the dam. Myanmar also began informal talks with Beijing and dam operator Yunnan International Power Investment, a unit of State Power Investment Corp. \\r\\nChina’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Beijing has previously said it would “maintain communication” with Myanmar over the project. \\r\\nFinding a solution is critical for Suu Kyi, who has benefited from Beijing’s support at the United Nations following a 2017 army crackdown that drove 730,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the former Burma. \\r\\nMyanmar also needs Beijing’s help in peace talks with several ethnic armed groups operating along northern and eastern borders with China. \\r\\nThaung Tun said original plans for the dam were not “thought out” and failed to consider the impact on the community and the environment. \\r\\nThe dam in the northern state of Kachin is very unpopular. Suu Kyi’s ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) lost a seat in Kachin by-elections last year and party officials have voiced concern about their popularity in ethnic minority areas ahead of the 2020 general election. \\r\\nChina’s Yunnan province, the planned destination for about 90 percent of the dam’s electricity, now has a power surplus, Thaung Tun said. \\r\\n“There’s no need for this dam now,” he said. \\r\\nOn Monday, Nobel laureate Suu Kyi opened the first government-led investment conference by calling on global investors to put their money in Myanmar, seeking to offset the negative impact of the Rohingya crisis and slow pace of economic reforms. \\r\\nReporting by Antoni Slodkowski; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in BEIJING; Editing by Darren Schuettler'},\n",

       "  'content': 'PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haitian police wary of renewed unrest after days of nationwide protests fired tear gas and rubber pellets on Friday to disperse about 200 protesters and mourners carrying the casket of a man killed last week in anti-government riots. \\r\\nPolice confronted the march near Haiti’s National Palace, scattering wailing relatives and chanting neighbors who left the casket on the ground next to a smoldering gas canister. \\r\\nAt least one man was hit in the arm and neck, where marble-sized welts swelled. \\r\\nThousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of Haiti’s main cities since Feb. 7, calling for President Jovenel Moise to step down to take responsibility for ballooning inflation, a weakening currency and allegations of misused funds from a Venezuelan oil subsidy scheme called PetroCaribe. \\r\\n“Today we lock down the country again,” opposition leader Schiller Louidor told a church full of people who gathered for a memorial for two protesters killed last week, then marched the roughly 1 km (0.6 mile) to the palace to the beat of drums. One man shot a pistol into the air. \\r\\nThe casket of the second man was transported from the church directly to the cemetery. \\r\\nThe two dead were among several people killed in the clashes, protesters say. The government has not given an official death toll. \\r\\n“We are asking for justice. We are going to continue to protest. Jovenel can kill as many people as he wants, he still has to go,” said Josef Dicles, a cousin of one of the dead men, Onique Gedeus. \\r\\nGedeus’ family said the 28-year-old was shot in the head by an unknown assailant on Feb. 13 as he waved the Haitian flag in the middle of the protests. \\r\\nPartially collapsed buildings, damaged during Haiti’s devastating 2010 earthquake, still line several blocks of downtown Port-au-Prince. People use some to dump their trash or relieve themselves, and one caught fire on Friday, sending a thick cloud of black, acrid smoke into the air. \\r\\nHaiti, the first nation to be formed by former slaves in 1804, is the poorest country in the Americas, its economic progress stunted by a long history of political instability, disastrous foreign interventions and mismanagement. \\r\\nIt was not immediately clear how many people would heed the opposition’s call to take to the streets again later on Friday. Small crowds were gathered on street corners around the capital, Port-au-Prince, some burning tires. \\r\\nThe size of some of the protests appeared to shrink by early evening Friday, mostly comprised of smaller groups and unable to block off major thoroughfares as had happened in the last round of protests. But discontent with the government, nonetheless, remained strong. \\r\\nJuan Maria Fontus, 36, complained about a lackluster economy and the challenges of accessing food and clean drinking water. “There is no work in Haiti and the government does nothing to help,” he said. \\r\\nThe injured man, Davidson Metellus, 35, said they would retrieve the casket left behind near the National Palace. “Even if there is only one of us left, we’re going to carry him to his grave,” said Metellus. \\r\\nReporting by Anthony Esposito; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel, Sonya Hepinstall and Leslie Adler'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Tokyo -- As Japan marks the eight-year anniversary of the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami that claimed some 22,000 lives, a new study suggests it could still be having a serious impact on the nation\\'s health. The disaster caused by the killer wave at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has been linked by the research to a significant spike in infant heart surgeries. \\r\\nWhile not a single death has been definitively attributed to radiation exposure from the leaks at the Fukushima plant, the study found the number of surgeries for children under the age of one with complex congenital heart disease, or CHD, spiked by more than 14 percent.\\r\\nThe study was led by Kaori Murase, an associate professor of natural sciences at Nagoya City University in central Japan, and published on Wednesday by the American Heart Association.\\r\\nAccording to Stanford Children\\'s Health, CHD, is the most common birth defect and usually has no identifiable cause. \"Complex\" CHD involves a combination of heart defects that cause either too much blood, or too little, to flow into the lungs or other parts of the body. \\r\\nEven after multiple surgeries, symptoms can afflict a patient throughout their life. The earlier abnormalities appear during the eight-week process of heart development in unborn babies, the more severe the damage generally is.\\r\\nFukushima\\'s ghost towns\\r\\n\"Our study suggests that a nuclear accident might increase the risk for complex congenital heart disease,\" Murase said, noting that the data suggest a catastrophic release of radiation anywhere in the world could precipitate similar problems.\\r\\nFor a four-year period beginning in 2011, the number of heart surgeries jumped by 14.2 percent in children under the age of one, compared to the four years prior to the disaster.\\r\\nThat number remained unusually high throughout 2014. It is unclear if the rise was triggered by the radiation from the nuclear accident, or the stress of the tragedy on women of childbearing age. \\r\\nThe panicked and disorganized evacuation following the Fukushima accident, loss of loved ones and family homes, break up of communities and general disruption of daily life were cited, as well as a possible rise in diabetes related to the evacuation.\\r\\nWhile her analysis ends in 2014, Murase believes infant CHD remains high even today. The analysis was done using data from the Japanese Association for Thoracic Surgery, which tracks nearly all CHD surgeries performed nationwide -- in effect, a near-complete patient population survey. \\r\\nThe study lacks breakdowns by location, individual data, and level of radiation exposure; and since CHD often requires multiple surgeries, the 14 percent rise does not reflect the incidence of CHD, just the actual surgeries performed.\\r\\nThe study found no significant rise in CHD in children older than the age of one. Murase said the Nagoya University findings were consistent with a suspected rise in CHD after the Chernobyl nuclear accident of 1986. \\r\\nShe cautioned that the study does not prove radiation caused heart disease in infants, but it does suggest a link.\\r\\nThe Fukushima disaster\\r\\nOn March 11, 2011, a Magnitude 9 earthquake struck northeast Japan. More than 22,000 people were killed or left missing. The tsunami flooded the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, damaging three nuclear reactors and triggering multiple meltdowns and explosions that released radiation over a large area. It was one of the worst nuclear accidents in history.\\r\\nChildren pray at a beach in Iwaki, Fukushima Prefecture, March 10, 2019, a day before the eighth anniversary of the 2011 earthquake-tsunami disaster in northeastern Japan.\\r\\nKyodo/Getty\\r\\nJapan continues to struggle with decommissioning the crippled nuclear reactors at Fukushima, a task expected to take decades. Despite assurances that most of Fukushima is now safe to live in and radiation levels have dropped to normal, the population of Fukushima prefecture, or state, is still down 8.4 percent from before the disaster.\\r\\nIn the former no-go zones exposed to radiation around the nuclear plant, less than a quarter of residents have returned.'},\n",

What was the reason for my friends debilitating chronic illness? Would it really work out for that couple whose infant died of pneumonia? I found myself working harder to explain the unexplainable. And then, four months ago, any remaining sense of order in the universe was destroyed by my wifes cancer diagnosis.\\r\\nI imagine that there are some people who could find meaning in our situation, people who might say that fate or the universe or Gods plan is more complex than we can ever hope to understand. And thats great. We all make our own meaning. For me, the optimistic fatalism of my 20s and 30s didnt fit anymore. And so I threw it out.\\r\\nIts been liberating in a way, letting go of the idea that theres a reason for everything. Justifying all that illness and rejection was a lot of work, energy Id rather spend counting my blessings and making the best of what weve been dealt.\\r\\nThese past few months driving my wife to chemotherapy, talking about mortality and whether I might have time to pick up a gallon of milk that afternoon Ive thought a lot about a prayer from the Jewish High Holy Days service, Unetaneh Tokef, which Leonard Cohen adapted into the song Who by Fire. Its a long poem, full of fear and trembling, the end of which contains a litany of ways you might die:\\r\\n Who shall perish by water and who by fire, Who by sword and who by wild beast,Who by famine and who by thirst,Who by earthquake and who by plague.\\r\\nWhen I was younger, I thought the prayer was metaphorical. Now, it feels all too real. But its oddly comforting, too, to look mortality in the eye. Because none of us really knows how many days we have left, and we have no idea what those days will bring.\\r\\nI had a dream the other night in which I could see the dark side of the moon. I looked up, and the dark side was as clear as the light. That just about sums it up for me, what turning 40 means. Its scary to let go of that youthful certainty, but Id rather embrace the unknown than ignore it. Because no matter how things turn out in the end, Im going to hug my daughters a little tighter tonight, and when my wife leans her head against my shoulder Im going to breathe in the smell of her hair a little deeper.'},\n",

Most were too small to feel, but 20 have had magnitudes of 4.5 or greater. Rupert expects the temblors to continue for months, although the frequency has lessened, from about 200 daily to a couple dozen a day.\\r\\nWith no end to the seismic action in sight, Laura Dykes said her upcoming vacation trip to Las Vegas will be a huge relief from the stress she now experiences. The Anchorage law firm worker still has vivid memories of her basement office in a building swaying back and forth during the November earthquake. It was built on rollers to protect it from seismic events.\\r\\n\"I can\\'t get out of here fast enough,\" Dykes said. \"It\\'ll be five days I can get sleep.\"\\r\\nThe earthquake buckled roads and some homes and buildings sustained heavy damage, with initial estimates to repair damage and other costs at about $100 million.\\r\\nBut most parts of Anchorage and other areas escaped the type of widespread catastrophic damage that happened in a devastating 1964 earthquake because of strict building codes that were put in place after that quake, which had a magnitude of 9.2 and was the second most powerful quake recorded on the planet.\\r\\nNo deaths or serious injuries were reported after the quake seven weeks ago, but federal officials soon declared a public health emergency and mental health aid was made available for people traumatized by the disaster. School counselors were swamped and crisis counselors were brought in from Oregon to help at several Anchorage-area schools. Therapists and other professionals struggled to meet demand from a nervous public.\\r\\nMental health providers say the rush of new patients has slowed, but they still treat clients rattled by the aftershocks, which strike without warning or any apparent pattern.\\r\\n\"It\\'s overwhelming for people, and they feel emotionally out of control,\" said Deborah Gonzales, a licensed clinical social worker in Anchorage.\\r\\nGonzales said people tell her they can\\'t stand the shaking and don\\'t feel safe anywhere. Some are considering moving out of state while others say they feel \"crazy\" feelings Gonzales called \"100 percent normal.\"\\r\\nFor Connor, every noticeable shake triggers feelings of vulnerability, said his mother, Tamra Cartwright, adding that many of her friends\\' children also struggle with quake-related fears.\\r\\nTamra Cartwright said her husband was at work when the main quake struck, but she and her sons ran out of the house and hugged each other as they huddled together outside. Along with broken family items, the only damage to their home was an existing hairline wall crack that was made wider. But Connor couldn\\'t sleep in his own bed for weeks and only just returned to it.\\r\\nHis mother said she \"totally\" hates the aftershocks, but tries to \"be strong for my kids.\"\\r\\nLifelong Alaskan Robert Bell was 12 during the 1964 earthquake and remembers it as a rolling action while the recent quake was more of a back-and-forth movement that felt more violent even though it wasn\\'t as powerful. The recent quake and its aftershocks have been like reliving that youthful experience over and over, Bell said.\\r\\nBell, who worked in construction for years, built his own home and says it\\'s safe and solid. But his heart races when the aftershocks hit.\\r\\n\"You don\\'t know when the next one\\'s going to hit that\\'s been unnerving,\" he said.\\r\\nThey\\'re also unsettling for Ethel Sechlera.

      "Content:  50 During Tianwangs heyday earlier this decade, Mr. Huang and his volunteers fielded up to 150 calls a day, which would feed into short articles. The site was hosted outside China and blocked inside the country, but many were able to read the posts by using software to bypass censorship.\r\n",
      "He represents this class of activists who used websites to expose official wrongdoings, said Patrick Poon, a researcher with Amnesty International in Hong Kong. His was one of the most famous.\r\n",
      "That reputation, however, also resulted in two decades worth of legal problems.\r\n",
      "Mr. Huang initially drew praise from pro-government outlets like Peoples Daily, the Communist Partys main mouthpiece, for helping to find missing persons. When he began to investigate other social problems, however, he ran into trouble.\r\n",
      "He was jailed from 2000 to 2005 for publishing articles by overseas dissidents, as well as ethnic and religious critics. It was during this period, he said in interviews, that he contracted serious ailments, especially after spending a year in solitary confinement, sleeping on a concrete floor.\r\n",
      "After his release, he again worked on the website but was jailed in 2010 after publicizing corrupt building practices that contributed to the death toll in the May 2008 earthquake in Wenchuan, Sichuan Province, reaching at least 69,000.

      "Content:  52 Set in Christchurch, New Zealand, a city still haunted by memories of the 2011 earthquake, the story centers on 16-year-old Laura (a fantastic Erana James), who lives with her overstressed mother (Melanie Lynskey) and little brother, Jacko (Benji Purchase). After Laura begins to receive psychic warnings that Jacko may be in danger, a strange old man (played by a deliciously unnerving Timothy Spall) develops an intense interest in the boy. At the same time, Laura is increasingly drawn to the glum, glamorously named Sorensen (Nicholas Galitzine), a stunner usually spied brooding on the fringes of school gatherings. Sorensen might be of dubious utility, but his mother and grandmother well, theyre something else entirely.\r\n",
      "Creating a world where men are mostly absent or suspect and women must work to save themselves, Stuart McKenzies thin but serviceable screenplay (he also directed with Miranda Harcourt) smartly favors human drama over hocus-pocus. The paranormal showdown is fuzzy at best, but the pacing rocks and Spall radiates such ingratiating evil that he needs no help from special effects. When, in one creepily insinuating moment, he steers a possessed Laura toward her bedroom to have some fun, the kick of dread we feel is not from the occult, but from a peril thats all too rooted in the everyday.\n",

      "Content:  54 ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish government amnesty on unregistered construction work is endangering lives, engineers and architects warned after an illegally extended residential building collapsed in Istanbul and killed 21 people. \r\n",
      "Three floors of the eight-story building had been built illegally, but owners of the property were able to register it under the amnesty that has brought in billions of dollars of revenue for the government. \r\n",
      "Experts say the ruins of the building, which crumpled two weeks ago in Istanbul’s Asian district of Kartal, highlight the dangers of approving unregulated construction work in a city of 15 million people that is prone to earthquakes. \r\n",
      "Some work has started to address safety concerns, but they say it is concentrated in wealthier neighborhoods, rather than highest risk areas, and the amnesty has exacerbated the peril. \r\n",
      "“It will mean transforming our cities, notably Istanbul, into graveyards and result in coffins emerging from our homes,” said Cemal Gokce, the chairman of the Chamber of Civil Engineers. \r\n",
      "“Whether it is completely unlicensed, or has more floors than the original plan, they gave an amnesty to all buildings. This is very dangerous,” he said. \r\n",
      "Some 10 million people applied to benefit from the amnesty and 1.8 million of the applications were accepted. \r\n",
      "Property owners pay to register the buildings, which are then subject to various taxes and levies. The amnesty had brought 16.5 billion lira ($3.1 billion) in property taxes and registration fees into government coffers, the urbanization minister said in December. \r\n",
      "His ministry did not respond to Reuters questions about criticism of the property amnesty, which was set to expire at the end of 2018 but has been extended until June. \r\n",
      "The government says it was needed to remove disagreements between the state and citizens, as well as to “give legality to these structures by registering them”. \r\n",

      "Content:  61 SEATTLE Years after the highway teardown movement helped reshape places like Boston and Seoul, this Pacific Northwest city is in the midst of a similar transformation. \r\n",
      "On Monday, the nations first double-decker traffic tunnel will open here, reaching more than 200 feet at its lowest point below the citys congested streets.\r\n",
      "The two-mile deep-bore tunnel is replacing the Alaskan Way Viaduct, an unsightly, earthquake-damaged elevated highway that runs along the citys picturesque waterfront.\r\n",
      "Leaders and planners had long derided the hulking concrete eyesore that separates popular waterfront attractions such as the Seattle Aquarium and Washington State Ferries from iconic landmarks, including Pike Place Market and the Seattle Art Museum.\r\n",
      "Now the viaducts celebrated replacement, 18 years after the Nisqually earthquake nearly brought it down, is expected not only to reorient the citys expanding skyline but finally merge its downtown with its tourist-heavy waterfront.\r\n",
      "Eight acres of new public parks, with a landscaped promenade and space for cycling and recreation, will emerge along 26 blocks from what is now the highways shadows.\r\n",
      "When we started studying options for the viaduct replacement we looked at the Embarcadero in San Francisco and understood what a great benefit opening up the waterfront to the public and having better access was going to be, said Paula J. Hammond, senior vice president at WSP USA, a multinational engineering and design firm.\r\n",
      "Hammond spent 35 years with the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and was transportation secretary during the early years of planning for the viaduct replacement. I think in the end, it will be just like in Boston, where visitors and residents walk along the Greenway and no one remembers all the haggling that went on, Hammond said. They love that corridor, and they love the parks and the open space, and think it was smartest thing Boston ever did.\r\n",
      "The new Highway 99 tunnel stretches from the industrial tangle south of downtown, near one of the West Coasts biggest seaports and two major stadiums, north to where the late Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Paul Allen over the past decade transformed a sleepy neighborhood into a vibrant commercial and residential corridor, now anchored by Amazon. It is the longest road tunnel in the contiguous United States, it will carry traffic along two lanes in each direction on two levels, with a posted speed limit of 45 mph.\r\n",
      "The $3.3 billion viaduct replacement is among a number of big-ticket transportation projects that will shift the way people and freight move around the region. Among them is an extension of the regions light-rail system running north of Seattle and another east across the Interstate 90 floating bridge to connect high-tech suburbs across Lake Washington.\r\n",
      "The project is similar to how Marylands light-rail Purple Line and phase two of the Metro Silver Line extension into Loudoun County will fill gaps in the Washington regions transportation network\r\n",
      "Washington state permanently closed the viaduct Jan. 11, sending 90,000 vehicles a day scrambling for alternative routes. Demolition will begin shortly after the tunnel opens.\r\n",
      "Built during the freeway construction frenzy of the 1950s as one of two north-south corridors through Seattle, the viaduct is part of State Route 99, a patchwork of surface streets, freeway segments and the 3,000-foot Battery Street tunnel.\r\n",
      "Homeless residents in tents and sleeping bags find shelter in its gritty underbelly, between the six-story concrete columns and parking lots.\r\n",
      "Mehran Sepehr, a business consultant who used to take the viaduct to his downtown offices multiple days a week, said he will miss the view it afforded from the top the downtown skyline to the east and the expanse of Puget Sound to the west and the Olympic Mountains beyond.\r\n",
      "I think for Seattle to be a truly great city, the viaduct had to come down, said Sepehr, who moved to Seattle in 2001, the year the Nisqually earthquake hit. This citys relationship with the water is one of its defining characteristics, and removing that artificial barrier between downtown and the waterfront will open up a whole new avenue for this city.\r\n",
      "Among those like him who used to drive nervously across the viaducts weathered frame, residents living within earshot of its unrelenting din and confused visitors negotiating its Gotham City-like underside, there are few tears being shed over the viaducts demise.\r\n",
      "Yet deciding how to replace the downtown highway embroiled this city in more than a decade of political drama, myriad citizen forums and stakeholder groups, three advisory ballot measures and an embarrassing two-year stall by a storied tunnel-drilling machine called Bertha. Throughout the process, every mayor and mayoral candidate in Seattle staked out a position on replacing the viaduct and about 90 replacement proposals were put forth before then-Gov. Christine Gregoire (D) put an end to it in 2009, announcing that the tunnel would be her pick. By then, the state had spent more than $325 million.\r\n",
      "This is not just about replacing a road, Gregoire said at a January 2009 news conference. This is about building a 21st-century city.\r\n",
      "Her motivation was safety, Gregoire said recently. I knew it was just a matter of time before Mother Nature took down both the viaduct and the 520 bridge, she said, referring to one of two floating bridges across Lake Washington.\r\n",
      "Initially, Gregoire and state transportation planners were against a deep-bore tunnel option as irresponsible and too expensive. But as the political debate raged, pressure from interest groups mounted and technology brought the cost of a tunnel within a budget officials thought was manageable.\r\n",
      "Gregoire recalls sitting down for dinner with former British Columbia premier Gordon Campbell, who, looking out toward Elliott Bay, spotted the viaduct and inquired, What is that monstrosity?\r\n",
      "In replacing it, she said, Well create an iconic waterfront, and everyone will look back and wonder what was wrong with us. Why didnt we do this a long time ago?\r\n",
      "Not everyone.\r\n",
      "Former Seattle mayor Michael McGinn (D), who won office in 2009 campaigning against the tunnel, continues to believe the state made the wrong choice.\r\n",

      "McGinn points to San Franciscos Embarcadero Freeway and the New Yorks West Side Highway as successful examples of deteriorating highways that were demolished and not replaced and not missed.\r\n",
      "This is the new face of climate change denialism and it runs deep in both political parties, McGinn said.\r\n",
      "Increasingly, states and the federal government will be forced to make these kinds of transportation decisions, the former mayor said. Do we continue doubling down and expanding the highway infrastructure, or do we, when the time comes, transition to transit, biking and walking as well as walkable communities?\r\n",
      "So Im not sure what we are celebrating here, McGinn said.\r\n",
      "The viaduct replacement has frequently invited comparisons to Bostons infamous Big Dig, the rerouting of that citys elevated downtown highway into an underground tunnel that was plagued by design flaws, enormous cost overruns and delays.\r\n",
      "The comparisons dogged Washington transportation officials, who early on had visited Boston and other cities to learn what went well and what did not.\r\n",
      "The state chose a design-build contract for the viaduct project, meaning the contractor, Seattle Tunnel Partners, was given creative freedom but would share in the risk of the project, which is three years behind schedule, including the two years Bertha was idle. The states $3.3 billion budget, almost two-thirds of it from state gas-tax revenue, includes the demolition of the viaduct; rebuilding streets at the tunnels portal and a portion of the major rebuild; and expansion of Alaskan Way, the street along the waterfront and beneath the viaduct. (Meanwhile, contractors have sued for up to $600 million to cover delays and repairs associated with Berthas breakdown.)\r\n",
      "Beginning midyear, the tunnel will have variable-rate tolls meaning they will fluctuate depending on the time of day ranging from $1 to $2.25.\r\n",
      "Designed with fire suppression and air monitoring and ventilation to measure and reduce the levels of vehicle emissions, the Highway 99 tunnel was built to withstand a 9.0-magnitude earthquake (which occur every 2,500 years, on average). A 24-hour tunnel control center will have direct lines to emergency responders.\r\n",
      "From the window of his antique store, which he has run for the past 40 years, Ken Eubank can see beyond the columns of the viaduct to a waterfront park, the Seattle Great Wheel and out toward Elliott Bay and Puget Sound.\r\n",
      "His Seattle Antiques Market, wedged between a storage business and Seattles only dedicated blues club, which closed on New Years Day, is among the warehouses and small businesses operating in the shadow of the viaduct.\r\n",
      "And while, like most, he is not sorry to see the viaduct go, its removal leaves him and other nearby business owners with something of a quandary. Eubank said he will probably mothball his store during the months of demolition this spring, and he has not decided whether he will reopen.\r\n",
      "My business plan is really good, Eubank jokes. My exit plan is terrible.\n",

      "The installation features large portraits of the students made from a million multi-colored Legos that hover above a cavernous exhibit space, images that have become seared into the Mexican conscience by grieving family members who often hoist posters with the same images at protests demanding answers for their sons’ disappearance. \r\n",

      "“Why do we have to do it? Because every crime creates a vacuum and it poisons society,” Ai told reporters at a news conference on Thursday. \r\n",
      "Known for his criticism of Communist-run China’s stifling of free expression, Ai said his latest project was partially inspired by the Chinese government’s refusal to explain its errors following a massive 2008 earthquake in Sichuan in which thousands of students died in government-built schools. \r\n",
      "“It reminded me of the Mexicans who lost their children,” he said, explaining how his own search for answers following the tragedy was stymied. \r\n",
      "An initial Mexican government investigation found that the Ayotzinapa students were abducted by corrupt police who handed them over to a local drug gang. The gang then killed them for reasons that remain unclear and burnt their bodies in a trash dump, discarding the ashes into a nearby river, it concluded. \r\n",

      "New Zealand Rugby said the decision to cancel the match in Dunedin, some 360 kilometers south of Christchurch, had been made after consultation with both teams, police and local authorities. \r\n",
      "The nine-times Super Rugby champion Crusaders are based in Christchurch. \r\n",
      "“Advice from police and venue management was that the fixture could go ahead, however, with strong agreement from both teams we have made the final call not to proceed as a mark of respect for the events that have occurred in Christchurch,” New Zealand Rugby’s Nigel Cass said in a statement. \r\n",
      "Crusaders chief executive Colin Mainsbridge said the attacks had stunned the entire community in the city, the South Island’s largest. \r\n",
      "“Yesterday’s horrific attacks have left us all feeling stunned,” Mainsbridge said. \r\n",
      "“All other issues and considerations pale in significance. \r\n",
      "“We will now regroup and make arrangements for the team to return home as soon as possible to be back in their community and with their families.” \r\n",
      "Highlanders chief executive Roger Clark said while the South Island derby was arguably the most high-profile of their regular season home games, it was the right decision to cancel. The Highlanders had been expecting a crowd of 20,000. \r\n",
      "“This is always the biggest fixture on our match calendar and one which our fans look forward to,” Clark said. \r\n",
      "“But when we think about the massive loss of life and absolute devastation that has been wreaked on people in Christchurch, we feel this is the right decision.” \r\n",
      "SECOND CANCELLATION \r\n",
      "The match is the second cancellation of a high-profile sporting event with the third cricket test between New Zealand and Bangladesh called off on Friday. It had been scheduled to begin in Christchurch on Saturday. \r\n",
      "Members of the Bangladesh team narrowly avoided being caught up in the shooting at the Al Noor mosque when they arrived for Friday prayers. \r\n",
      "Police have said 41 people were killed at the mosque, while seven others died at the Linwood mosque. One more died in hospital later. \r\n",
      "It is the second time in the last decade that a Crusaders match in Super Rugby has been canceled. \r\n",
      "Their clash with the Wellington Hurricanes in late February 2011 was scratched after the devastating earthquake that flattened much of central Christchurch and killed almost 200 people. \r\n",
      "That match was deemed a draw and both teams awarded two points by governing body SANZAAR. \r\n",
      "A NZR spokesperson said the decision on the points for Saturday’s game would be made by SANZAAR, who were not immediately available for comment. \r\n",
      "The Super Rugby match between the Waikato Chiefs and Wellington Hurricanes in Hamilton on Friday went ahead, although players and the crowd observed a minute’s silence before kickoff. \r\n",
      "There was also a minute’s silence before the ACT Brumbies match with the New South Wales Waratahs in Canberra, and at the National Rugby League match between Sydney Roosters and South Sydney Rabbitohs at Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday evening. \r\n",

      "Content:  86 NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - A top Myanmar investment official on Tuesday suggested alternatives such as scaling back or relocating a stalled Chinese-backed dam project that has strained ties between the neighbors. \r\n",
      "Myanmar angered China in 2011 when its former quasi-civilian government suspended the $3.6 billion Myitsone hydro-power dam in the country’s north amid environmental concerns. \r\n",
      "Asked about the dam at an investment conference, Thaung Tun, chairman of Myanmar’s investment commission, listed several problems, from an earthquake fault line running under the project site to a large catchment area affecting residents. \r\n",
      "“Catchment area would be twice the size of Singapore. This would mean that a lot of villages will have been displaced from their accessible land. That is the issue,” Thaung Tun told reporters at the conference in the capital Naypyitaw. \r\n",
      "Thaung Tun listed several alternatives, including scaling back the dam, moving it to a different location, or offering the operator an alternative project. He did not say if the government had a preferred option. \r\n",
      "Myanmar had to consider its relations with China, its largest trade partner, and “was working hard to find the solution,” he said. \r\n",
      "Spearheading these efforts is a commission launched by Aung San Suu Kyi’s government, which came to power in 2016, to review the dam. Myanmar also began informal talks with Beijing and dam operator Yunnan International Power Investment, a unit of State Power Investment Corp. \r\n",
      "China’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Beijing has previously said it would “maintain communication” with Myanmar over the project. \r\n",
      "Finding a solution is critical for Suu Kyi, who has benefited from Beijing’s support at the United Nations following a 2017 army crackdown that drove 730,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the former Burma. \r\n",
      "Myanmar also needs Beijing’s help in peace talks with several ethnic armed groups operating along northern and eastern borders with China. \r\n",
      "Thaung Tun said original plans for the dam were not “thought out” and failed to consider the impact on the community and the environment. \r\n",
      "The dam in the northern state of Kachin is very unpopular. Suu Kyi’s ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) lost a seat in Kachin by-elections last year and party officials have voiced concern about their popularity in ethnic minority areas ahead of the 2020 general election. \r\n",
      "China’s Yunnan province, the planned destination for about 90 percent of the dam’s electricity, now has a power surplus, Thaung Tun said. \r\n",
      "“There’s no need for this dam now,” he said. \r\n",
      "On Monday, Nobel laureate Suu Kyi opened the first government-led investment conference by calling on global investors to put their money in Myanmar, seeking to offset the negative impact of the Rohingya crisis and slow pace of economic reforms. \r\n",

      "Content:  87 PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haitian police wary of renewed unrest after days of nationwide protests fired tear gas and rubber pellets on Friday to disperse about 200 protesters and mourners carrying the casket of a man killed last week in anti-government riots. \r\n",
      "Police confronted the march near Haiti’s National Palace, scattering wailing relatives and chanting neighbors who left the casket on the ground next to a smoldering gas canister. \r\n",
      "At least one man was hit in the arm and neck, where marble-sized welts swelled. \r\n",
      "Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of Haiti’s main cities since Feb. 7, calling for President Jovenel Moise to step down to take responsibility for ballooning inflation, a weakening currency and allegations of misused funds from a Venezuelan oil subsidy scheme called PetroCaribe. \r\n",
      "“Today we lock down the country again,” opposition leader Schiller Louidor told a church full of people who gathered for a memorial for two protesters killed last week, then marched the roughly 1 km (0.6 mile) to the palace to the beat of drums. One man shot a pistol into the air. \r\n",
      "The casket of the second man was transported from the church directly to the cemetery. \r\n",
      "The two dead were among several people killed in the clashes, protesters say. The government has not given an official death toll. \r\n",
      "“We are asking for justice. We are going to continue to protest. Jovenel can kill as many people as he wants, he still has to go,” said Josef Dicles, a cousin of one of the dead men, Onique Gedeus. \r\n",
      "Gedeus’ family said the 28-year-old was shot in the head by an unknown assailant on Feb. 13 as he waved the Haitian flag in the middle of the protests. \r\n",
      "Partially collapsed buildings, damaged during Haiti’s devastating 2010 earthquake, still line several blocks of downtown Port-au-Prince. People use some to dump their trash or relieve themselves, and one caught fire on Friday, sending a thick cloud of black, acrid smoke into the air. \r\n",
      "Haiti, the first nation to be formed by former slaves in 1804, is the poorest country in the Americas, its economic progress stunted by a long history of political instability, disastrous foreign interventions and mismanagement. \r\n",
      "It was not immediately clear how many people would heed the opposition’s call to take to the streets again later on Friday. Small crowds were gathered on street corners around the capital, Port-au-Prince, some burning tires. \r\n",
      "The size of some of the protests appeared to shrink by early evening Friday, mostly comprised of smaller groups and unable to block off major thoroughfares as had happened in the last round of protests. But discontent with the government, nonetheless, remained strong. \r\n",
      "Juan Maria Fontus, 36, complained about a lackluster economy and the challenges of accessing food and clean drinking water. “There is no work in Haiti and the government does nothing to help,” he said. \r\n",
      "The injured man, Davidson Metellus, 35, said they would retrieve the casket left behind near the National Palace. “Even if there is only one of us left, we’re going to carry him to his grave,” said Metellus. \r\n",

      "Content:  90 Tokyo -- As Japan marks the eight-year anniversary of the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami that claimed some 22,000 lives, a new study suggests it could still be having a serious impact on the nation's health. The disaster caused by the killer wave at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has been linked by the research to a significant spike in infant heart surgeries. \r\n",
      "While not a single death has been definitively attributed to radiation exposure from the leaks at the Fukushima plant, the study found the number of surgeries for children under the age of one with complex congenital heart disease, or CHD, spiked by more than 14 percent.\r\n",
      "The study was led by Kaori Murase, an associate professor of natural sciences at Nagoya City University in central Japan, and published on Wednesday by the American Heart Association.\r\n",
      "According to Stanford Children's Health, CHD, is the most common birth defect and usually has no identifiable cause. \"Complex\" CHD involves a combination of heart defects that cause either too much blood, or too little, to flow into the lungs or other parts of the body. \r\n",
      "Even after multiple surgeries, symptoms can afflict a patient throughout their life. The earlier abnormalities appear during the eight-week process of heart development in unborn babies, the more severe the damage generally is.\r\n",
      "Fukushima's ghost towns\r\n",
      "\"Our study suggests that a nuclear accident might increase the risk for complex congenital heart disease,\" Murase said, noting that the data suggest a catastrophic release of radiation anywhere in the world could precipitate similar problems.\r\n",
      "For a four-year period beginning in 2011, the number of heart surgeries jumped by 14.2 percent in children under the age of one, compared to the four years prior to the disaster.\r\n",
      "That number remained unusually high throughout 2014. It is unclear if the rise was triggered by the radiation from the nuclear accident, or the stress of the tragedy on women of childbearing age. \r\n",
      "The panicked and disorganized evacuation following the Fukushima accident, loss of loved ones and family homes, break up of communities and general disruption of daily life were cited, as well as a possible rise in diabetes related to the evacuation.\r\n",
      "While her analysis ends in 2014, Murase believes infant CHD remains high even today. The analysis was done using data from the Japanese Association for Thoracic Surgery, which tracks nearly all CHD surgeries performed nationwide -- in effect, a near-complete patient population survey. \r\n",
      "The study lacks breakdowns by location, individual data, and level of radiation exposure; and since CHD often requires multiple surgeries, the 14 percent rise does not reflect the incidence of CHD, just the actual surgeries performed.\r\n",
      "The study found no significant rise in CHD in children older than the age of one. Murase said the Nagoya University findings were consistent with a suspected rise in CHD after the Chernobyl nuclear accident of 1986. \r\n",
      "She cautioned that the study does not prove radiation caused heart disease in infants, but it does suggest a link.\r\n",
      "The Fukushima disaster\r\n",
      "On March 11, 2011, a Magnitude 9 earthquake struck northeast Japan. More than 22,000 people were killed or left missing. The tsunami flooded the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, damaging three nuclear reactors and triggering multiple meltdowns and explosions that released radiation over a large area. It was one of the worst nuclear accidents in history.\r\n",
      "Children pray at a beach in Iwaki, Fukushima Prefecture, March 10, 2019, a day before the eighth anniversary of the 2011 earthquake-tsunami disaster in northeastern Japan.\r\n",
      "Kyodo/Getty\r\n",
      "Japan continues to struggle with decommissioning the crippled nuclear reactors at Fukushima, a task expected to take decades. Despite assurances that most of Fukushima is now safe to live in and radiation levels have dropped to normal, the population of Fukushima prefecture, or state, is still down 8.4 percent from before the disaster.\r\n",
      "In the former no-go zones exposed to radiation around the nuclear plant, less than a quarter of residents have returned.\n",

      "Content:  92 Being a novelist having spent most of my adult life throwing obstacles in front of flawed but ultimately well-meaning characters Id like to think Im pretty good at this kind of retrospective meaning-making, picking out the thread of causality that might explain the larger significance behind a fender bender or a mold infestation in the closet.\r\n",
      "As I got closer to 40, however, those bumps in the road became bigger and more difficult to explain. What was the reason for my friends debilitating chronic illness? Would it really work out for that couple whose infant died of pneumonia? I found myself working harder to explain the unexplainable. And then, four months ago, any remaining sense of order in the universe was destroyed by my wifes cancer diagnosis.\r\n",
      "I imagine that there are some people who could find meaning in our situation, people who might say that fate or the universe or Gods plan is more complex than we can ever hope to understand. And thats great. We all make our own meaning. For me, the optimistic fatalism of my 20s and 30s didnt fit anymore. And so I threw it out.\r\n",
      "Its been liberating in a way, letting go of the idea that theres a reason for everything. Justifying all that illness and rejection was a lot of work, energy Id rather spend counting my blessings and making the best of what weve been dealt.\r\n",
      "These past few months driving my wife to chemotherapy, talking about mortality and whether I might have time to pick up a gallon of milk that afternoon Ive thought a lot about a prayer from the Jewish High Holy Days service, Unetaneh Tokef, which Leonard Cohen adapted into the song Who by Fire. Its a long poem, full of fear and trembling, the end of which contains a litany of ways you might die:\r\n",
      " Who shall perish by water and who by fire, Who by sword and who by wild beast,Who by famine and who by thirst,Who by earthquake and who by plague.\r\n",
      "When I was younger, I thought the prayer was metaphorical. Now, it feels all too real. But its oddly comforting, too, to look mortality in the eye. Because none of us really knows how many days we have left, and we have no idea what those days will bring.\r\n",
      "I had a dream the other night in which I could see the dark side of the moon. I looked up, and the dark side was as clear as the light. That just about sums it up for me, what turning 40 means. Its scary to let go of that youthful certainty, but Id rather embrace the unknown than ignore it. Because no matter how things turn out in the end, Im going to hug my daughters a little tighter tonight, and when my wife leans her head against my shoulder Im going to breathe in the smell of her hair a little deeper.\n",

      "They shake the earth far less than the 7.0 magnitude quake that sent a mirror, TV and dishes crashing to the ground in the Anchorage home where Connor lives with his mother, father and 11-year-old brother.\r\n",
      "But the seemingly never-ending aftershocks deepen quake anxiety for the second-grader and many other Alaska residents in the wide swath of the state shaken by the Nov. 30 quake.\r\n",
      "When the big aftershocks hit, Connor fears his home will collapse.\r\n",
      "\"I feel like the house won't hold up,\" he said.\r\n",
      "Many of the aftershocks are so small that people don't notice them, like a recent one that Connor didn't feel at school but his teacher made all the students dive under their desks to be safe.\r\n",
      "The latest big aftershock happened last Sunday a magnitude 5.0 jolt that flared already frayed nerves and prompted panicky posts on social media.\r\n",
      "That one \"reminded people again that it's not over yet,\" said seismologist Natalia Rupert at the Alaska Earthquake Center.\r\n",
      "There have been more than 7,800 aftershocks since the main earthquake struck 7 miles (11 kilometers) north of Anchorage, the state's most populous city. Most were too small to feel, but 20 have had magnitudes of 4.5 or greater. Rupert expects the temblors to continue for months, although the frequency has lessened, from about 200 daily to a couple dozen a day.\r\n",
      "With no end to the seismic action in sight, Laura Dykes said her upcoming vacation trip to Las Vegas will be a huge relief from the stress she now experiences. The Anchorage law firm worker still has vivid memories of her basement office in a building swaying back and forth during the November earthquake. It was built on rollers to protect it from seismic events.\r\n",
      "\"I can't get out of here fast enough,\" Dykes said. \"It'll be five days I can get sleep.\"\r\n",
      "The earthquake buckled roads and some homes and buildings sustained heavy damage, with initial estimates to repair damage and other costs at about $100 million.\r\n",
      "But most parts of Anchorage and other areas escaped the type of widespread catastrophic damage that happened in a devastating 1964 earthquake because of strict building codes that were put in place after that quake, which had a magnitude of 9.2 and was the second most powerful quake recorded on the planet.\r\n",
      "No deaths or serious injuries were reported after the quake seven weeks ago, but federal officials soon declared a public health emergency and mental health aid was made available for people traumatized by the disaster. School counselors were swamped and crisis counselors were brought in from Oregon to help at several Anchorage-area schools. Therapists and other professionals struggled to meet demand from a nervous public.\r\n",
      "Mental health providers say the rush of new patients has slowed, but they still treat clients rattled by the aftershocks, which strike without warning or any apparent pattern.\r\n",
      "\"It's overwhelming for people, and they feel emotionally out of control,\" said Deborah Gonzales, a licensed clinical social worker in Anchorage.\r\n",
      "Gonzales said people tell her they can't stand the shaking and don't feel safe anywhere. Some are considering moving out of state while others say they feel \"crazy\" feelings Gonzales called \"100 percent normal.\"\r\n",
      "For Connor, every noticeable shake triggers feelings of vulnerability, said his mother, Tamra Cartwright, adding that many of her friends' children also struggle with quake-related fears.\r\n",
      "Tamra Cartwright said her husband was at work when the main quake struck, but she and her sons ran out of the house and hugged each other as they huddled together outside. Along with broken family items, the only damage to their home was an existing hairline wall crack that was made wider. But Connor couldn't sleep in his own bed for weeks and only just returned to it.\r\n",
      "His mother said she \"totally\" hates the aftershocks, but tries to \"be strong for my kids.\"\r\n",
      "Lifelong Alaskan Robert Bell was 12 during the 1964 earthquake and remembers it as a rolling action while the recent quake was more of a back-and-forth movement that felt more violent even though it wasn't as powerful. The recent quake and its aftershocks have been like reliving that youthful experience over and over, Bell said.\r\n",
      "Bell, who worked in construction for years, built his own home and says it's safe and solid. But his heart races when the aftershocks hit.\r\n",
      "\"You don't know when the next one's going to hit that's been unnerving,\" he said.\r\n",
      "They're also unsettling for Ethel Sechlera. But the Anchorage supermarket cashier considers them a way for the ground to let out seismic pressures.\r\n",
      "\"I'd rather have the little aftershocks to keep from having the big one hit,\" she said.\r\n",
      "Others shrug off the aftershocks as part of daily life in the most seismically active region of the U.S.\r\n",

      "Severe quake hits Southern California; at least 24 dead\r\n",
      "By CATHERINE O'BRIEN, Associated Press Writer\r\n",
      "LOS ANGELES A violent earthquake struck Southern California before dawn today, turning freeways into rubble, collapsing buildings with a savage power and igniting fires that sent swirls of smoke across the hazy, battered city. At least 24 people died.\r\n",
      "The quake, centered in the San Fernando Valley, buckled overpasses on three freeways, trapping motorists in tons of concrete rubble. It severed Interstate 5, California's main north-south highway, and Interstate 10, the nation's busiest freeway.\r\n",
      "\"This place was moving like a jackhammer was going at it,\" said Richard Goodis of Sherman Oaks, an affluent San Fernando Valley suburb. \"Our bedroom wall tore away. I was looking at the ceiling one moment, then I was looking at the sky. I thought we were dead.\"\r\n",
      "The quake derailed a freight train carrying hazardous material and briefly closed several airports, including Los Angeles International. Power and telephone service were lost throughout Southern California.\r\n",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and California Gov. Pete Wilson declared states of emergency, and President Clinton said he expected to issue a federal disaster declaration later in the day.\r\n",
      "Wilson called out the National Guard. In addition, fire rescue teams responded from as far away as San Francisco.\r\n",
      "The quake struck at 4:31 a.m., and measured a preliminary 6.6 on the Richter scale, said Kate Hutton, a seismologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Although not as strong as some quakes in recent years, it was unusually destructive because of its location in a populous area.\r\n",
      "A swarm of aftershocks, some as strong as 5 on the Richter scale, jostled the region throughout the morning, and seismologists said they could continue for several days.\r\n",
      "The dead, according to hospital and police reports, were:\r\n",
      "Fourteen people crushed to death in an apartment building in Northridge.\r\n",
      "Five people who died of quake-related heart attacks, three at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and two at Holy Cross Medical Center in Sylmar.\r\n",
      "Two people who died when a hillside home collapsed in Sherman Oaks.\r\n",
      "One woman who broke her neck when she slipped and struck a crib at her home in Rancho Cucamonga in San Bernardino County.\r\n",
      "A Los Angeles police officer whose motorcycle sailed off a severed freeway overpass, falling nearly 25 feet to the road below.\r\n",
      "A person who fell from a sixth-floor window at a downtown hotel.\r\n",
      "Referring to the ruins of the Northridge apartment building, fire Capt. Steve Bascom said: \"We've got a three-story apartment that's now a two-story. ... We've got people we're pulling out all the time.\"\r\n",
      "The building, half a block from California State University, Northridge, housed mostly college students. An identical building next to it buckled, but didn't collapse. Hundreds of people watched firefighters search the rubble.\r\n",
      "The entire building \"shifted north about six feet,\" said fire Battalion Chief Bob De Feo. A third-floor resident, Eric Pearson, told Cable News Network that he felt a huge jolt that lifted the building off its foundation, moved it over and slammed it down.\r\n",
      "In a dramatic and dangerous rescue nearby, searchers spent hours digging through the wreckage of a parking garage at the Northridge Fashion Center before pulling out a 35-year-old street sweeper alive. The quake had turned the multi-story garage into a 20-foot-high pancake of concrete, and transformed the mall's Bullocks department store into a gnarled pile of concrete and steel.\r\n",
      "Richard Andrews, California's emergency services director, said the early hour and the Martin Luther King holiday reduced the number of people exposed to injury in the quake.\r\n",
      "That was easy to forget in the chaos at the Sylmar hospital, which was swamped by more than 250 new patients. The hospital's disaster coordinator, Mark Wallerstein, told those without serious injury to go elsewhere.\r\n",
      "\"We have no power, no laboratory, no X-rays, no pharmacy and almost no food,\" Wallerstein told them. He later said the hospital was operating on emergency power.\r\n",
      "In Los Angeles, Cedars Sinai was receiving \"a tidal wave of walking wounded,\" hospital spokesman Ron Wise said.\r\n",
      "Three other hospitals, Holy Cross, Panorama City and Sepulveda, were forced to evacuate patients because of quake damage.\r\n",
      "Sylmar, the epicenter of a devastating earthquake in 1971 that killed 65, was blanketed by a black haze of smoke. From the air, at least 30 to 40 homes could be seen burning.\r\n",
      "Nearby in Granada Hills, water from broken water mains raged through the streets. In one of the weirdest effects of the quake, fireballs from ruptured gas mains exploded in the midst of the floods.\r\n",
      "Residents formed lines, filling buckets with water from a swimming pool and tossing the water onto their homes, hoping to prevent the spread of fire.\r\n",
      "Elsewhere, motorists driving north from Los Angeles on the Golden State Freeway saw fires raging out of control on both sides of the road, red balls of flame exploding 30 feet in the air.\r\n",
      "Fires also were reported in Sherman Oaks and elsewhere in the region.\r\n",
      "Throughout Los Angeles, the sound of burglar alarms, car alarms and emergency sirens blended into a constant wail.\r\n",
      "Six people were arrested in downtown Los Angeles for looting, and an undetermined number of others were arrested in the San Fernando Valley.\r\n",
      "Riordan said there had been \"major damage\" from the quake, but insisted that the city had the situation under control.\r\n",
      "Perhaps the most dramatic damage from the quake was the freeway destruction, which threatened to cripple the region's transportation system.\r\n",
      "On the Santa Monica Freeway, Interstate 10, which ferries hundreds of thousands of commuters between the west side of Los Angeles and downtown every day, an overpass at Fairfax Avenue buckled like a wave, dropping to about six feet from street level.\r\n",
      "\"That freeway will be closed for quite a while,\" Riordan said.\r\n",
      "But far more horrific was the collapse of a four-level intersection of Interstates 5 and 14, known as the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways. Cars could be seen crushed beneath the collapsed intersection; huge slabs of steel-reinforced concrete were splayed at crazy angles.\r\n",
      "The collapse was not far from the scene of a similar disaster in 1971.\r\n",
      "A portion of state Route 118, the Simi Valley Freeway, also collapsed.\r\n",
      "The quake derailed a 64-car freight train, which leaked sulphuric acid from one of its tankers between the communities of Chatsworth and Northridge, Southern Pacific Railroad spokesman Jack Martin said. Hazardous materials crews were cleaning up the spill.\r\n",
      "The city Department of Water and Power urged residents to boil drinking water contaminated by broken mains. At mid-day, at least 625,000 customers were without power in Central and Southern California, said Southern California Edison.\r\n",
      "Because of the interdependence of Western power grids, brief power outages caused by the quake were reported as far north as Portland, Ore., and Seattle.\r\n",
      "The epicenter of today's quake was Northridge, according to Lucy Jones, a seismologist at the California Institute of Technology. Northridge is a college community in the valley 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.\r\n",
      "The San Fernando Valley is a suburban expanse that spreads for 50 miles north of downtown. Most of it is within the city of Los Angeles.\r\n",
      "U.S. Geological Survey spokesman Robert Wesson said of the quake: \"It's not the Big One we hear about so often. The real impact of this earthquake is because it has occurred in a metropolitan area.\"\r\n",
      "He added that he was surprised by the damage to the freeways because freeway construction standards were improved - and freeways upgraded - after the 1971 quake.\r\n",
      "The quake was felt at least as far away as San Diego, 125 miles to the south, and Las Vegas, 275 miles to the east.\r\n",
      "It lasted for 30 seconds or more, and several aftershocks followed within minutes. In homes throughout the area, dishes fell off shelves, fixtures swayed and furniture slid across floors.\r\n",
      "In the San Fernando Valley community of Studio City, Jan Klunder said his apartment \"looks like it's been ransacked.\" The toll included a china cabinet that fell onto his dining room table, pictures that tumbled off walls, a television that smashed onto the floor, a refrigerator that overturned, spewing its contents onto the floor, and kitchen cabinets that disgorged still more food.\r\n",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration closed Los Angeles International Airport for about two hours as a precaution.\r\n",
      "In Washington, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced it was setting up a regional operating center in Southern California to provide assistance to state and local officials.\r\n",
      "Today's earthquake followed about 12 quakes near Santa Monica, the strongest of which was 3.7. Hutton said she didn't know whether those quakes were linked to today's.\r\n",
      "The last big earthquake to hit the area was on June 28, 1992. The Landers quake, east of Los Angeles, measured 7.5 on the Richter scale and was followed a few hours later by a magnitude 6.6 quake in the Big Bear area.\n",

      "A look back at the damage, deaths and developments in seismic safety since the disaster:\r\n",
      "———\r\n",
      "THE QUAKE\r\n",
      "At 4:31 a.m. on Jan. 17, 1994, a hidden fault lurking under the city's San Fernando Valley neighborhoods unleashed a magnitude 6.7 earthquake that shattered buildings, broke water mains and ignited fires.\r\n",
      "The so-called blind thrust fault one with no surface features to reveal its presence caused a block of earth to move upward. Most of the energy was released toward mountains that line the northern side of the valley, but there was more than enough energy sent in other directions to cause devastation.\r\n",
      "The ground shook horizontally and vertically for up to 10 seconds, most strongly in an area 30 miles (48 kilometers) in diameter around LA's Northridge neighborhood, according to the public-private partnership Earthquake Country Alliance . It was felt as far away as Las Vegas.\r\n",
      "———\r\n",
      "DEATHS AND INJURIES\r\n",
      "The state said at least 57 died in the earthquake, though a study issued the following year put the death toll at 72, including heart attacks. About 9,000 were injured.\r\n",
      "The greatest concentration of deaths occurred at the Northridge Meadows, a 163-unit apartment complex where 16 people were killed when it collapsed onto the parking area below, crushing first-floor apartments.\r\n",
      "The catastrophe at Northridge Meadows revealed a particular seismic hazard due to so-called soft-story construction in which a building's ground level has large open areas for purposes such as parking spots or shop windows.\r\n",
      "———\r\n",
      "DAMAGE\r\n",
      "The widespread damage to buildings, freeways and infrastructure made the Northridge quake the costliest U.S. disaster at the time.\r\n",
      "According to Earthquake Country Alliance, 82,000 residential and commercial units and 5,400 mobile homes were damaged or destroyed, nine parking structures toppled, nine hospitals were evacuated due to structural or other problems, seven key freeway bridges collapsed, and hundreds more were damaged.\r\n",
      "Some 200 steel-frame high-rises sustained cracked welds.\r\n",
      "Among vivid images from the quake were scenes of vehicles stranded high on an elevated section of freeway with the road fallen away in front and behind, and the wrecked motorcycle of a police officer who plunged to his death off the end of a broken overpass while rushing to work in the early morning darkness.\r\n",
      "The California Department of Transportation, which had already retrofitted many of the bridges that ended up being damaged, would spend hundreds of millions of dollars to further strengthen numerous bridges identified as being at risk.\r\n",
      "The damage to hospitals led the state to require strengthening of those buildings.\r\n",
      "———\r\n",
      "LEGACY\r\n",
      "Since Northridge there has been a push toward progress sometimes frustratingly slow on everything from making buildings safer to increasing society's overall ability to deal with seismic threats.\r\n",
      "In 2008, an annual earthquake drill known as the Great ShakeOut began in Southern California to teach the basic safety technique of \"drop, cover and hold on.\" Initially based on a scenario of a magnitude 7.8 quake on the southern end of the mighty San Andreas fault, the drill has since spread across the United States and around the world.\r\n",
      "In 2015, Los Angeles enacted a mandatory retrofit ordinance aimed at preventing loss of life in major earthquakes at the city's most vulnerable buildings. It covered about 13,500 \"soft-story\" buildings like Northridge Meadows and some 1,500 buildings with \"non-ductile reinforced concrete\" construction.\r\n",
      "The ordinance, however, allowed a process spanning seven years for retrofitting of soft-story buildings and 25 years for non-ductile reinforced concrete buildings.\r\n",
      "Last year, the U.S. Geological Survey announced its fledgling West Coast earthquake early warning system was ready for broad use by businesses, utilities, transportation systems and schools after years of development and testing of prototypes. The system detects the start of an earthquake and sends alerts that can give warnings ranging from several seconds to a minute before shaking arrives, depending on distance from the epicenter. That can be enough time to slow trains, stop industrial processes and allow students to scramble under desks.\r\n",
      "This month, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti unveiled a mobile app that uses the early warning system to alert Los Angeles County residents when there is an earthquake of magnitude 5.0 or greater. Other mobile apps are in development.\r\n",
      "Also this month, the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. released a guide aimed at helping businesses minimize disruptions from major earthquakes, taking advantage of information technologies such as the digital cloud to keep a company working even if its physical systems are destroyed or inaccessible.\n",

      "Title:  102 Republicans at U.S. nuclear regulator pass stripped down safety rule\n",
      "Content:  102 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans on the U.S. nuclear power regulator approved a stripped down safety rule on Thursday that removes the need for nuclear plants to take extra measures based on recent science to protect against hazards such as floods and earthquakes. \r\n",
      "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a board of three Republicans and two Democrats, approved the rule on a 3-2 vote along party lines. Dissents are rare on the NRC and the two Democrats strongly disagreed with the approval. \r\n",
      "They said the Republican decision could allow plants to avoid protections against risks of natural disasters that have become apparent with science methods that have evolved since most plants were built about 40 years ago. \r\n",
      "A draft rule that included the measures was formed in the wake of the 2011 nuclear disaster at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi plant that was damaged by an earthquake and tsunami, which forced more than 160,000 people from their homes. The draft was presented to the commission in 2016. \r\n",
      "Commissioner Jeff Baran, a Democrat, said NRC staff had included the extra safety measures in the draft after years of work, but Republicans had jettisoned them. \r\n",
      "“Instead of requiring nuclear power plants to be prepared for the actual flooding and earthquake hazards that could occur at their sites, the NRC will allow them to be prepared only for the old out-of-date hazards typically calculated decades ago when the science of seismology and hydrology was far less advanced than it is today.” \r\n",
      "NRC Chairman Kristine Svinicki, a Republican, said after the vote that the commission’s work since 2011 has resulted in “tangible safety improvements at every U.S. nuclear power plant.” \r\n",
      "Svinicki said that although the Democrats were concerned that the rule ignores flooding and earthquake hazards, “in the view of the commission majority this is not the case.” Regulations already in place already address the issues, she added. \r\n",
      "A nuclear power safety advocate said new information showed that plants may experience bigger floods and earthquakes than they are now required to withstand, and that it is possible the commission will not require nuclear plants that face greater hazards to make upgrades. \r\n",
      "“Nuclear plants must be protected against the most severe natural disasters they could face today - not those estimated 40 years ago,” when many plants were built, Edwin Lyman, acting director of the Nuclear Safety Project at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said. \r\n",

      "Content:  103 Six months after Palu was ripped apart by an earthquake, tsunami and liquefying soil that sucked neighborhoods into the earth and killed thousands, a second crisis is looming as recovery efforts stumble and a city that feels ignored begs for humanitarian assistance.\r\n",
      "Thousands of people in this city on Indonesia's Sulawesi island are still living in sweltering tent cities, while construction of new permanent homes has yet to start and almost a third of temporary housing is unoccupied after aid groups and authorities failed to connect the units to essential utilities.\r\n",
      "President Joko Widodo, who is seeking a second term in elections this week, and his deputy promised that financial assistance to those whose homes were destroyed or whose loved ones were killed would be rapidly distributed. But not a cent has been paid out.\r\n",
      "\"It's like we're forgotten,\" said Ade Zahra, a mother of eight living in a tent city who says it's a miracle her family survived when the quake turned their village to mud and engulfed their home.\r\n",
      "\"We've received no more assistance in the past two months, not only the government, but also humanitarian groups and volunteers who used to provide a lot,\" she said.\r\n",
      "The city's struggle to recover highlights a broader problem of neglect often suffered by remote regions in Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago home to hundreds of ethnic groups. Far from the center of economic, political and cultural power in populous Java, the region around Palu has a history of sectarian conflict and perceived indifference to its plight could embolden hard-liners.\r\n",
      "City officials, meanwhile, are worried frustration among the displaced has reached a breaking point.\r\n",
      "As anger among the refugees simmers, Widodo is focused on securing his reelection. Sulawesi mostly voted for Widodo in 2014, but he risks losing ground there this time. That could be crucial if the race is tighter than polls, which are predicting a strong Widodo victory.\r\n",
      "The Sept. 28 earthquake spawned a large localized tsunami that wiped out coastal areas, while liquefaction caused by the shaking turned entire neighborhoods into rivers of sludge. The disaster killed more than 4,400 people, making it the world's deadliest seismic event in 2018.\r\n",
      "The central government, at the time still grappling with the aftermath of deadly earthquakes on Lombok Island, appealed for international aid but didn't declare a national disaster, which would've opened the door wider to foreign assistance. It prohibited international aid organizations from operating on the ground.\r\n",
      "Though the tragedy is fading from the national consciousness, large parts of Palu look like they were struck only yesterday, a daily reminder to residents of the horrors they lived through.\r\n",
      "About 90% of roads have been repaired, according to Palu's mayor, but the shoreline is littered in debris and hollowed out buildings that lean precariously.\r\n",
      "Waves wash inside Apung Palu Mosque, which once sat majestically on pillars in Palu Bay. People looking for valuables pick through a vast jumble of personal belongings and house debris, all that's left of once thriving communities.\r\n",
      "In Sigi district bordering Palu, several dozen white tents emblazoned with the U.N. refugee agency's logo are home to hundreds of evacuees, who look with envy and anger at temporary housing across the road some of it occupied, some empty and some still unfinished.\r\n",
      "During the day, the tents are blazing hot and at night refugees, who include a man incapacitated by a stroke and a boy with cerebral palsy, shiver.\r\n",
      "Frustrated residents recall that not long after the disaster Vice President Jusuf Kalla visited and promised they'd soon get money to help rebuild their lives. Instead things seem to be getting worse.\r\n",
      "They have clean drinking water, but a mobile kitchen provided by an aid group closed due to lack of donations. Members of some families have jobs, but others have almost nothing, their former livelihoods gone. Some beg for money.\r\n",
      "Zahra, the mother of eight, said she hopes the government finally fulfills its promise.\r\n",
      "\"Have mercy on us,\" she said.\r\n",
      "Officially, about 173,000 people were displaced by the disaster and about 20,000 are still living in tents that Palu's mayor says were designed to last three months. The actual number without stable housing is much higher.\r\n",
      "At a block of eight buildings built by a charitable foundation run by Kalla's business empire, a banner announced they were handed over to the city on Feb. 14. All sit empty and unconnected to utilities, the only sign of life a few cows grazing between them.\r\n",
      "Temporary housing built nearby by another organization is occupied, some by residents of a neighborhood wiped out by liquefaction.\r\n",
      "Umira, who uses a single name, wept as she recalled the ordeal her family has endured since the night they fled a sea of moving trees and houses. Eight of her relatives were killed, including her grandson.\r\n",
      "They've gone from sheltering in a sports stadium to fashioning their own makeshift lodging in the ruins of a house to finally being assigned to a room in a temporary housing unit.\r\n",
      "\"We all cried with happiness,\" she said of the moment two months ago when they learned they would have housing. \"Even my husband cried and hugged the wall of our new home.\"\r\n",
      "The family still gets aid, Umira said, such as staple foods and cooking oil, though it's distributed without any predictable schedule.\r\n",
      "When the aid runs out they rely on income from running an on-call motorcycle taxi service.\r\n",
      "\"If there is a call, we can eat,\" she said. \"If not, we will only eat rice with salt.\"\r\n",
      "Presley Tampubolon, the head of Palu's disaster agency who oversees temporary housing, said the need for accommodation has been greater than anticipated.\r\n",
      "For every house destroyed or damaged, there would often be several generations of a family living in it. He said it would be \"inhuman\" to expect such families to fit into the 3-meter-by-4-meter (10-foot-by-13-foot) rooms that have been built.\r\n",
      "He said the government and aid groups have built temporary buildings with 5,300 total rooms that can accommodate nearly 41,000 people. But about 1,600 of those rooms are empty because they weren't connected to water, electricity or sanitation, he said.\r\n",
      "Hidayat, the mayor of Palu who uses a single name, said the central government has stopped building temporary homes despite the need and construction of permanent dwellings hasn't started.\r\n",
      "Compounding the problem is that the central government's social affairs and public works ministries haven't released \"mourning allowances\" and funds for people to build new homes.\r\n",
      "He said he's worried anger will soon boil over.\r\n",
      "The social affairs ministry's director of social protection and disaster victims, Margo Wiyono, said the ministry has verified 1,906 of the 4,400 names of heirs who would be entitled to mourning allowances and has proposed the finance ministry pay them.\r\n",
      "He said they were still investigating the rest.\r\n",
      "\"We don't want the allowances worth 15 million rupiah ($1,050) per heir to fall into the hands of irresponsible people,\" he said.\r\n",
      "The budget director-general at the finance ministry, Askolani, said it's in the process of approving money to pay the allowances. He said releasing funds for new housing is contingent on several factors, including reviewing local government data and identifying areas for new settlements that are safe from liquefaction.\r\n",
      "Hidayat isn't waiting. He said the Tzu Chi Buddhist Foundation has agreed to build 3,000 new homes in the Palu area, but he is urging organizations and local governments from around the country to build more.\r\n",
      "\"Our regional capabilities are very limited,\" he said. \"As the mayor, I'm begging for help to many humanitarian groups and institutions.\"\n",

      "    The capital Port-au-Prince’s fragile power grid was dealt a blow when Novum Energy Trading Corp suspended shipments in February, leaving residents without electricity for days and many gas stations with no fuel at the pumps. \r\n",
      "Novum says the government owes it $40 million in overdue payments for fuel. Haitian officials did not reply to requests for comment. \r\n",
      "The Western Hemisphere’s poorest nation, Haiti long relied on fuel shipments from nearby OPEC member Venezuela, which offered cheap financing to several Caribbean nations to buy its gasoline, diesel and other products through a program called Petrocaribe. \r\n",
      "    But the scheme fell apart last year due to economic turmoil in Venezuela, forcing Haiti - a nation of 11 million people - to return to international markets. \r\n",
      "    Novum, which has supplied Haiti with fuel for more than four years, stepped up its shipments as the Petrocaribe deal unravelled. Novum said it supplied 80 percent of Haiti’s gasoline and diesel needs last year. \r\n",
      "On Feb. 27, Novum anchored a vessel carrying 150,000 barrels of gasoline off Port-au-Prince until the payment dispute could be resolved. The cargo was equivalent to roughly half of Haiti’s monthly consumption of gasoline, according to industry experts. \r\n",
      "   After more than a month waiting, Novum on April 4 said the situation was “untenable” and sent the vessel to Jamaica to take on provisions. \r\n",
      "Youri Chevry, mayor of Port-au-Prince, a sprawling city of more than 2.6 million people, said electricity and gasoline shortages had grown worse over the past month as Haiti waited for the shipment. \r\n",
      "“It’s a very bad situation ... It has a lot of repercussions,” he said. \r\n",
      "    Chris Scott, Novum’s chief financial officer, said the vessel would not dock until the government could pay. He said Novum had taken such measures “fairly regularly” since mid-2018 as Haiti started to fall behind on payments after the Petrocaribe program collapsed. \r\n",
      "    “They need to pay in order for us to be able to discharge,” Scott said. \r\n",
      "   A government official, who asked not to be identified, said fuel distribution companies in Haiti had not paid the government for gasoline and diesel it purchased on their behalf from Novum. That in turn meant the government could not pay the U.S. company for the fuel. \r\n",

      "Corruption is a perennial concern in Haiti. The nation ranked 166 from 183 countries in Transparency International’s global survey of perceptions of corruption last year - only Venezuela had a worse ranking in the Western Hemisphere. \r\n",
      "International pressure has grown for an investigation. In a March 20 letter, 104 member of the U.S. Congress asked President Donald Trump’s government to support investigations into Petrocaribe in Haiti, pointing to the alleged misuse of $2 billion in low-interest loans under the scheme. \r\n",
      "At the height of the Petrocaribe program, Venezuelan fuel covered nearly 70 percent of Haiti’s needs. Venezuela provided long-term financing for the oil on flexible terms, with a maximum 2 percent interest rate and a two-year grace period. \r\n",
      "Petrocaribe included a fund for infrastructure and social projects in member countries. \r\n",
      "By April 2018, Venezuela was no longer exporting fuel to Haiti, according to documents from Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA seen by Reuters. \r\n",
      "After the program lapsed, Haitian energy companies lacked the hard U.S. currency to be able to buy fuel on international markets, said an executive at one firm, who asked not to be identified. \r\n",

      "    “No serious projects have been completed: no hospitals, no campus for students, no roads, no housing projects,” he said. \r\n",
      "An oft-heard lament on the streets of Port-au-Prince is that while politicians pilfer billions, Haitians go hungry. Roads in the city are potholed and the vestiges of a deadly 2010 earthquake can still be seen at practically every corner. \r\n",

      "Content:  115 Sixty-six million years ago, a massive asteroid crashed into a shallow sea near Mexico. The impact carved out a 90-mile-wide crater and flung mountains of earth into space. Earthbound debris fell to the planet in droplets of molten rock and glass.\r\n",
      "Ancient fish caught glass blobs in their gills as they swam, gape-mouthed, beneath the strange rain. Large, sloshing waves threw animals onto dry land, then more waves buried them in silt. Scientists working in North Dakota recently dug up fossils of these fish: They died within the first minutes or hours after the asteroid hit, according to a paper published Friday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a discovery that has sparked tremendous excitement among paleontologists.\r\n",
      "Youre going back to the day that the dinosaurs died, said Timothy Bralower, a Pennsylvania State University paleoceanographer who is studying the impact crater and was not involved with this work. Thats what this is. This is the day the dinosaurs died. \r\n",
      "About 3 in 4 species perished in what is called the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction, also known as the K-Pg event or K-T extinction. The killer asteroid most famously claimed the dinosaurs. But T. rex and Triceratops were joined by hordes of other living things. Freshwater and marine creatures were victims, as were plants and microorganisms, including 93 percent of plankton. (A lone branch of dinosaurs, the birds, lives on.)\r\n",
      "Four decades of research buttresses the asteroid extinction theory, widely embraced as the most plausible explanation for disappearing dinosaurs. In the late 1970s, Luis and Walter Alvarez, a father-son scientist duo at the University of California at Berkeley, examined an unusual geologic layer between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods. The boundary was full of the element iridium, which is rare in Earths crust, but not in asteroids. Walter Alvarez is one of the authors of the new study.\r\n",
      "The Hell Creek fossils represent the first mass death assemblage of large organisms anyone has found that sits at the K-Pg boundary, study author Robert DePalma said in a statement.\r\n",
      "DePalma, a doctoral student at the University of Kansas, began excavating the site at North Dakotas Hell Creek formation in 2013. Since then, DePalma and other paleontologists have found heaps of fossilized sturgeon and paddlefish with glass spheres still in their gills.\r\n",
      "They found squidlike animals called ammonites, shark teeth and the remains of predatory aquatic lizards called mosasaurs. They found dead mammals, insects, trees and a Triceratops. They found foot-long fossil feathers, dinosaur tracks and prehistoric mammal burrows. They found fossilized tree gunk called amber that had captured the glass spheres, too.\r\n",
      "The site has all the trademark signals from the Chicxulub impact, Bralower said, including the glass beads and lots of iridium. In the geologic layer just above the fossil deposit, ferns dominate, the signs of a recovering ecosystem. Its spellbinding, he said.\r\n",
      "In the early 1990s, researchers found the scar left by the asteroid a crater in the Yucatan Peninsula. The impact was named after the nearby Mexican town of Chicxulub. Suggested kill mechanisms for the Chicxulub impact abound: It may have poisoned the planet with heavy metals, turned the ocean to acid, shrouded Earth in darkness or ignited global firestorms. Its punch may have triggered volcanoes that spewed like shaken soda cans.\r\n",
      "Hell Creek is more than 2,000 miles from the Chicxulub crater. But a hail of glass beads, called tektites, rained there within 15 minutes of the impact, said study author Jan Smit, a paleontologist at Vrije University in Amsterdam who also was an early discoverer of iridium at the K-Pg boundary.\r\n",
      "The fish, pressed in the mud like flowers in a diary, are remarkably well-preserved. Its the equivalent of finding people in life positions buried by ash after Pompeii, Bralower said.\r\n",
      "At the time of the dinosaurs, the Hell Creek site was a river valley. The river fed into an inland sea that connected the Arctic Ocean to a prehistoric Gulf of Mexico. After the asteroid struck, seismic waves from a magnitude 10 to 11 earthquake rippled through this sea, according to the study authors.\r\n",
      "This caused not a tsunami but whats known as seiche waves, the back-and-forth sloshes sometimes seen in miniature in a bathtub. These can be symptoms of very distant tremors such as the seiche waves that churned in Norwegian fjords in 2011 after the giant Tohoku earthquake near Japan.\r\n",
      "Seiche waves from the inland sea reached 30 feet, drowning the river valley in a pulse of water, gravel and sand. The rain of rocks and glass followed. The tektites dug small funnels in the sediment laid down by the seiche, Smit said, so you know for sure they are coming down when the waves are still running upriver. This is preservation, in other words, of a fresh hell.\r\n",

      "Content:  116 PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) A new city policy requiring public signs on brick buildings warning they might collapse in an earthquake is part of a long history of white supremacy aimed at forcing black people to move out of neighborhoods, the NAACP of Portland, Oregon, says.\r\n",
      "The group on Thursday decried the policy affecting some 1,600 unreinforced masonry buildings that are on average 90 years old, many in areas with a predominantly black population, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports .\r\n",
      "The policy exacerbates a long history of systemic and structural betrayals of trust and policies of displacement, demolition, and dispossession predicated on classism, racism, and white supremacy, the group said.\r\n",
      "The NAACP said the policy will make it tougher for owners of brick buildings to get loans and will discourage investment. It says that means buildings will have to be sold, and that developers will demolish and redevelop, increasing the cost to live there and forcing current residents out.\r\n",
      "It speaks to our houses of worship and everything about the black presence in the North-Northeast area, said the Rev. E.D. Mondaine, a pastor at Celebration Tabernacle Church in north Portland and president of the Portland NAACP chapter.\r\n",
      "City officials say the ordinance approved in October is part of an effort ultimately aimed at upgrading old buildings to withstand an earthquake, though seismic upgrades likely wouldnt be required for at least 20 years. Such upgrades could cost brick-building owners millions of dollars.\r\n",
      "Experts say Portland is at risk because theres close to a 50 percent chance of a giant earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone off the Oregon coast in the next 50 years.\r\n",
      "The warning signs and a requirement that building owners must file a record of compliance is really just a disclosure, said Alex Cousins, a spokesman for the city Bureau of Development Services. Thats the purpose behind it.\r\n",
      "The warning signs are to go up on public buildings this month, and on most other buildings by March 1. The warning on them says: This is an unreinforced masonry building. Unreinforced masonry buildings may be unsafe in the event of a major earthquake.\r\n",
      "In related action, a nonprofit coalition of Portland brick building owners recently filed a lawsuit seeking to block the ordinance, arguing its unconstitutional under free-speech and due-process rights.\r\n",
      "The government is forcing private property owners to basically broadcast the governments message instead of their own, said John DiLorenzo, an attorney for the group.\r\n",
      "Also, a coalition of music venues called MusicPortland has sided with the NAACP, saying the ordinance threatens some 30 of its music venues.\r\n",

      "A look back at the damage, deaths and developments in seismic safety since the disaster:\r\n",
      "___\r\n",
      "THE QUAKE\r\n",
      "At 4:31 a.m. on Jan. 17, 1994, a hidden fault lurking under the citys San Fernando Valley neighborhoods unleashed a magnitude 6.7 earthquake that shattered buildings, broke water mains and ignited fires.\r\n",
      "The so-called blind thrust fault one with no surface features to reveal its presence caused a block of earth to move upward. Most of the energy was released toward mountains that line the northern side of the valley, but there was more than enough energy sent in other directions to cause devastation.\r\n",
      "The ground shook horizontally and vertically for up to 10 seconds, most strongly in an area 30 miles (48 kilometers) in diameter around LAs Northridge neighborhood, according to the public-private partnership Earthquake Country Alliance . It was felt as far away as Las Vegas.\r\n",
      "___\r\n",
      "DEATHS AND INJURIES\r\n",
      "The state said at least 57 died in the earthquake, though a study issued the following year put the death toll at 72, including heart attacks. About 9,000 were injured.\r\n",
      "The greatest concentration of deaths occurred at the Northridge Meadows, a 163-unit apartment complex where 16 people were killed when it collapsed onto the parking area below, crushing first-floor apartments.\r\n",
      "The catastrophe at Northridge Meadows revealed a particular seismic hazard due to so-called soft-story construction in which a buildings ground level has large open areas for purposes such as parking spots or shop windows.\r\n",
      "___\r\n",
      "DAMAGE\r\n",
      "The widespread damage to buildings, freeways and infrastructure made the Northridge quake the costliest U.S. disaster at the time.\r\n",
      "According to Earthquake Country Alliance, 82,000 residential and commercial units and 5,400 mobile homes were damaged or destroyed, nine parking structures toppled, nine hospitals were evacuated due to structural or other problems, seven key freeway bridges collapsed, and hundreds more were damaged.\r\n",
      "Some 200 steel-frame high-rises sustained cracked welds.\r\n",
      "Among vivid images from the quake were scenes of vehicles stranded high on an elevated section of freeway with the road fallen away in front and behind, and the wrecked motorcycle of a police officer who plunged to his death off the end of a broken overpass while rushing to work in the early morning darkness.\r\n",
      "The California Department of Transportation, which had already retrofitted many of the bridges that ended up being damaged, would spend hundreds of millions of dollars to further strengthen numerous bridges identified as being at risk.\r\n",
      "The damage to hospitals led the state to require strengthening of those buildings.\r\n",
      "___\r\n",
      "LEGACY\r\n",
      "Since Northridge there has been a push toward progress sometimes frustratingly slow on everything from making buildings safer to increasing societys overall ability to deal with seismic threats.\r\n",
      "In 2008, an annual earthquake drill known as the Great ShakeOut began in Southern California to teach the basic safety technique of drop, cover and hold on. Initially based on a scenario of a magnitude 7.8 quake on the southern end of the mighty San Andreas fault, the drill has since spread across the United States and around the world.\r\n",
      "In 2015, Los Angeles enacted a mandatory retrofit ordinance aimed at preventing loss of life in major earthquakes at the citys most vulnerable buildings. It covered about 13,500 soft-story buildings like Northridge Meadows and some 1,500 buildings with non-ductile reinforced concrete construction.\r\n",
      "The ordinance, however, allowed a process spanning seven years for retrofitting of soft-story buildings and 25 years for non-ductile reinforced concrete buildings.\r\n",
      "Last year, the U.S. Geological Survey announced its fledgling West Coast earthquake early warning system was ready for broad use by businesses, utilities, transportation systems and schools after years of development and testing of prototypes. The system detects the start of an earthquake and sends alerts that can give warnings ranging from several seconds to a minute before shaking arrives, depending on distance from the epicenter. That can be enough time to slow trains, stop industrial processes and allow students to scramble under desks.\r\n",
      "This month, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti unveiled a mobile app that uses the early warning system to alert Los Angeles County residents when there is an earthquake of magnitude 5.0 or greater. Other mobile apps are in development.\r\n",
      "Also this month, the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. released a guide aimed at helping businesses minimize disruptions from major earthquakes, taking advantage of information technologies such as the digital cloud to keep a company working even if its physical systems are destroyed or inaccessible.\n",

      "The decision to open a food kitchen only steps away from the White House and the U.S. Capitol is both practical and symbolic, Andrés said during a phone interview from Puerto Rico today.\r\n",
      "Practically, the free #ChefsforFeds kitchen will feed federal workers and their families during the partial government shutdown, now in its fourth week. In this sense, the operation in downtown Washington will not be too far removed from the food relief that World Central Kitchen the organization that Andrés launched after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti  has offered in Puerto Rico, Houston, Florida, North Carolina, Tijuana, Guatemala and other locales where people have suffered after natural or man-made disasters.\r\n",
      "I believe its an emergency, Andrés told The Washington Post about the partial federal shutdown. I believe these people are going to be suffering, and we are a food relief organization.\r\n",
      "But on another level, the relief kitchen on Pennsylvania Avenue NW the site is currently a test kitchen for the chefs ThinkFoodGroup, which is donating the space for the cause is a symbolic display designed to spark political dialogue to end the shutdown, which is in its 24th day.

We should always come together as we the people, as Americans, bipartisan.\r\n",
      "In the interview with The Post, Andrés said his relief kitchen sends a message that were here for the people. It sends a message that our leaders should come together and find common ground.\r\n",
      "As such, Andrés said, he will institute a policy for any politician who tries to turn the #ChefsforFeds kitchen into a grandstanding opportunity. World Central Kitchen, he said, will warmly accept any politico who wants to volunteer at the temporary kitchen, but only if he or she brings along someone from the opposite party.

      "The #ChefsforFeds kitchen will debut on Wednesday at 701 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, and it will run from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. The volunteer chefs will not only have hot meals available for federal workers who show a government ID, but also ingredients and recipes for workers to take home to feed their families. The latter component is important to Andrés; he remembers being a child back in Spain when his own family was living paycheck to paycheck. The days near the end of the month could be tough, he recalled. They forced his mother to come up with creative way to reuse leftovers.\r\n",

ThinkFoodGroup has been handing out 200 to 300 free sandwiches a day at each restaurant, Andrés said. He estimates that between food costs and labor, his restaurant group has so far spent more than $50,000 feeding government employees.\r\n",

      "Content:  131 Jeff Estes has worked as a federal contractor for 35 years in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Now he and his colleagues are out of work because of a partial government shutdown that as of Saturday became the longest in American history.For Estes, a union official and electrician, the shutdown is becoming particularly burdensome because he's paying for his two kids to attend college, and the government's recent decision to change contractors forced him and his coworkers to reapply for their jobs.With much of the government at a standstill, Estes and his colleagues aren't sure whether they will still have a job when it's over, he said. Those in a position to know are furloughed, leaving Estes and many others more than frustrated as the government shutdown enters its 22nd day on Saturday.#embed-20190110-longest-shutdown iframe {width: 1px;min-width: 100%}\r\n",
      "\"It's not a D problem. It's not an R problem. It's Washington, D.C., the Beltway,\" Estes told NBC News. \"People in America and the workforce should not be used as pawns. Deal with your business without putting me out of the job. Do your job, and I'll keep doing mine.\"Approximately 800,000 federal employees are estimated to be furloughed or working without pay because President Donald Trump and Congress cannot reach a deal to reopen the government. They are at an impasse over $5.7 billion for construction of a wall along the southern border.The number of furloughed employees does not include federal contractors like Estes. It's unclear how many contract or grant employees are affected by the shutdown or even how many there are in total but a Volcker Alliance report estimated that nearly 5.3 million worked as contractors in 2015.Unlike furloughed federal employees, who have received assurances that they will be paid once the shutdown ends, contractors are not owed back pay.

They depend on that paycheck coming in every month.\"Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she knows the shutdown is having a significant impact on her state, telling NBC News that she has spoken to a number of constituents since the shutdown took effect.\r\n",

Alaska has the most federal workers affected per capita than any other state, and nearly half the federal workers there work for agencies without appropriations.\"They're the ones who are trying to knit this all together, that are trying to figure out, 'OK, we've got earthquake damage that we're dealing with and it's costing us more than we thought it was going to,\" Murkowski said. \"It's cold. It's four below in Fairbanks, where I went to high school, this morning. You don't think that jacks up people's home heating like sky high?\"That could be a reason for economic concern beyond just the individual household, particularly in small communities where businesses are dependent on those individuals spending their paychecks.\"When individuals are living as close to the edge as such a large fraction of Americans are living, these are the kinds of events that can precipitate a downward spiral,\" Stiglitz said.Politics\r\n",

So expect them [agency costs] to grow.\"It's the uncertainty that leaves a lot of experts worried about the economic impact that a prolonged shutdown could have, especially during a period of global market uncertainty.Currently the country faces a trade war, stock market uncertainty, an economic slowdown in China and an economic slowdown in Europe two key trading partners.\"No time is a good time, but this is a particularly bad time because the nature of uncertainty is that it compounds exponentially,\" Stiglitz said.\"We're talking about $5.7 billion for a wall,\" the economist added, \"but the costs that are inflicted on the economy are orders of magnitude beyond that $5.7 billion.\"\n",

      "More, importantly, Wilmot said, \"if it keeps going on for a long time, then its going to have an adverse impact on everyones operational readiness.\"\r\n",
      "\"I do know that I feel a pressure that Ive never felt before in my life,\" said John Cannon, another firefighter on the base and a 45-year resident of Kodiak.

      "But there is no sign that the shutdown, now 26 days old, will end anytime soon and many federal employees aren't being paid, even if they are deemed essential enough to be needed on the job.\r\n",

      "\"The biggest thing for us is we are going to go to work and we are going to operate at 100 percent and its going to be safe,\" said Mauro. \"You know, that may come with the cost of efficiency, but were always going to be safe. But eventually without our support staff, how long can we maintain that is the question, to keep everything running as efficiently as we are now.\"\r\n",
      "Weather forecasters, meanwhile, are also still at work and the weather reports many people in the region critically rely on are still going out.\r\n",

Locally, the government organized a charrette - a 10 day meeting where both sides were forced to come together and find a solution.

      "Content:  152 RIO DE JANEIRO/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Brazilian miner Vale SA identified concerns around its tailings dams in 2009 and studied but did not implement several steps that could have prevented or lessened the damage from last week’s deadly disaster, according to a corporate presentation seen by Reuters. \r\n",
      "A tailings dam, used to store the muddy detritus of the mining process, collapsed on Friday, killing at least 65 in one of Brazil’s largest industrial accidents on record. \r\n",
      "The Brumadinho disaster, coming just over three years after a similar incident at another mine partially controlled by Vale, has fueled calls for a management overhaul and erased more than 70 billion reais ($18.61 billion) in Vale’s market value. \r\n",
      "But a decade ago, the world’s largest iron ore miner was considering ways to use fewer tailings dams, including alternative uses for the waste rock, according to the 73-page presentation. \r\n",
      "The presentation pointed to the rising volume of tailings produced at the company’s mines, with some locations producing hundreds of thousands of tonnes of tailings daily. \r\n",
      "The report suggested Vale make building materials from tailings, including bricks, a step that would give the company another revenue source and lessen the volume needing to be stored using dams. \r\n",
      "The 2009 Vale report had recommended the company undertake a project to be called “Zero Dams” that would have involved drying out tailings, among other steps. It was not known whether the report reached the top levels of Vale management nor why it was not implemented. \r\n",
      "Vale declined to comment. The report’s author, Paulo Ricardo Behrens da Franca, left Vale a year after submitting it and now works as an industry consultant. Reached by Reuters, he did not comment. \r\n",
      "‘INHERENTLY DANGEROUS STRUCTURES’ \r\n",
      "Vale’s Brumadinho facility was built using the cheapest and least-stable type of tailings dam design, a commonly used structure in mining known as “upstream construction.” \r\n",
      "Chile, Peru and other earthquake-prone countries ban the design, in which tailings are used to progressively construct dam walls the more a mine is excavated. Brazil is not as earthquake-prone as its western neighbors, but even small seismic activity has been shown to affect tailings dams. \r\n",
      "Because these types of tailings dams are waterlogged, they are easily susceptible to cracks and other damage that can cause bursts like the one that occurred last week near Brumadinho. \r\n",
      "“A tailings dam may look safe, but it’s still retaining a lot of moisture behind it,” said Dermot Ross-Brown, a mining industry engineer who teaches at the Colorado School of Mines. “They’re inherently dangerous structures.” \r\n",
      "Tailings dams tend to be shorter in height than conventional water dams, but often are far wider in span. \r\n",
      "The disaster’s cause remains unknown. Vale said the dam had not received tailings for about two and a half years and was in the process of decommissioning, a step that should have lessened risk, engineers said. \r\n",
      "“It’s really puzzling to me this happened as the (dam) was closing,” said Cameron Scott of SRK Consulting, a mining engineering firm. “This disaster will make future mine permitting harder.” \r\n",

      "Title:  153 Exclusive: Vale eyed dam design changes in 2009 that may have prevented disaster\n",
      "Content:  153 RIO DE JANEIRO/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Brazilian miner Vale SA identified concerns around its tailings dams in 2009 and studied but did not implement several steps that could have prevented or lessened the damage from last week’s deadly disaster, according to a corporate presentation seen by Reuters. \r\n",
      "A tailings dam, used to store the muddy detritus of the mining process, collapsed on Friday, killing at least 65 in one of Brazil’s largest industrial accidents on record. \r\n",
      "The Brumadinho disaster, coming just over three years after a similar incident at another mine partially controlled by Vale, has fueled calls for a management overhaul and erased more than 70 billion reais ($18.61 billion) in Vale’s market value. \r\n",
      "But a decade ago, the world’s largest iron ore miner was considering ways to use fewer tailings dams, including alternative uses for the waste rock, according to the 73-page presentation. \r\n",
      "The presentation pointed to the rising volume of tailings produced at the company’s mines, with some locations producing hundreds of thousands of tonnes of tailings daily. \r\n",
      "The report suggested Vale make building materials from tailings, including bricks, a step that would give the company another revenue source and lessen the volume needing to be stored using dams. \r\n",
      "The 2009 Vale report had recommended the company undertake a project to be called “Zero Dams” that would have involved drying out tailings, among other steps. It was not known whether the report reached the top levels of Vale management nor why it was not implemented. \r\n",
      "Vale declined to comment. The report’s author, Paulo Ricardo Behrens da Franca, left Vale a year after submitting it and now works as an industry consultant. Reached by Reuters, he did not comment. \r\n",
      "Late Tuesday, Vale said it would take as much as 10 percent of its ore output offline in order to decommission 10 more dams like the one that burst last week. \r\n",
      "‘INHERENTLY DANGEROUS STRUCTURES’ \r\n",
      "Vale’s Brumadinho facility was built using the cheapest and least-stable type of tailings dam design, a commonly used structure in mining known as “upstream construction.” \r\n",
      "Chile, Peru and other earthquake-prone countries ban the design, in which tailings are used to progressively construct dam walls the more a mine is excavated. Brazil is not as earthquake-prone as its western neighbors, but even small seismic activity has been shown to affect tailings dams. \r\n",
      "Because these types of tailings dams are waterlogged, they are easily susceptible to cracks and other damage that can cause bursts like the one that occurred last week near Brumadinho. \r\n",
      "“A tailings dam may look safe, but it’s still retaining a lot of moisture behind it,” said Dermot Ross-Brown, a mining industry engineer who teaches at the Colorado School of Mines. “They’re inherently dangerous structures.” \r\n",
      "Tailings dams tend to be shorter in height than conventional water dams, but often are far wider in span. \r\n",
      "The disaster’s cause remains unknown. Vale said the dam had not received tailings for about two and a half years and was in the process of decommissioning, a step that should have lessened risk, engineers said. \r\n",
      "“It’s really puzzling to me this happened as the (dam) was closing,” said Cameron Scott of SRK Consulting, a mining engineering firm. “This disaster will make future mine permitting harder.” \r\n",
      "The dam had passed a September 2018 inspection by the German firm TUEV SUED AG and Vale Chief Executive Fabio Schvartsman said equipment had shown the dam was stable on Jan. 10. \r\n",

      "Content:  154 TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo Electric Power has begun removing spent nuclear fuel rods from a second building at the wrecked Fukushima plant, using remote-controlled cranes to lift hundreds of radioactive cylinders from a highly contaminated reactor site. \r\n",
      "The company, known as Tepco, said on Monday that it had successfully removed the first of more than 560 fuel rod assemblies by 0051 GMT from the No. 3 reactor and placed it in a specially designed steel cask for transfer to the ground. \r\n",
      "The reactor was one of three reactors at Fukushima that suffered meltdowns after a 2011 earthquake and tsunami shut down the plant’s cooling systems. \r\n",
      "In 2014, Tepco finished the removal fuel rods from the No. 4 reactor. However, the removal operation for the No. 3 site will be much more difficult because of the damage it suffered in the 2011 disaster, with an explosion covering the pool where the rods currently sit in debris, including a crane. \r\n",
      "The damage and debris removal delayed the No. 3 operations for four years. Additionally, the highly irradiated air around the site means all the cranes moving the transportation casks carrying the rods, which weigh abut 45 tonnes, must be operated remotely. \r\n",
      "Tepco must pluck the brittle and potentially damaged assemblies from a flooded compartment on the reactor site that is 18 meters (60 feet) above ground level and place them in containment casks, raise the casks from the pool and place them on a truck on the ground to transport them to a final pool of water for storage. \r\n",
      "If the rods are exposed to air or if they break, radioactive gases could be released into the atmosphere. \r\n",
      "“The work is expected to completed in March 2021, but safety is our first priority,” spokesman Joji Hara told Reuters. \r\n",
      "The 2011 disaster forced 160,000 people to evacuate areas nearby the Fukushima plant, and many of them have never returned to the most contaminated areas. \r\n",
      "Japan’s government estimated in 2016 that the total cost of dismantling Fukushima, decontaminating the affected areas, and paying compensation would amount to 21.5 trillion yen ($192 billion), around 20 percent of the country’s annual budget. \r\n",
      "Even with the successful transfer of the fuel rods, Tepco faces other problems at Fukushima. \r\n",
      "Tepco has struggled for more than eight years with rising levels of contaminated water that comes from its jerry-rigged cooling system for the melted reactor cores, in addition to power failures and water leaks. Last year, Tepco said a system meant to purify contaminated water had failed to remove dangerous radioactive contaminants, setting back efforts to deal with the water that is piling up in tanks covering the site. \r\n",

      "Content:  155 OXFORD, England (Reuters) - Eight years after the Fukushima nuclear meltdown in Japan, radioactive particles collected from the site are undergoing new forensic investigation in Britain in an effort to understand the exact sequence of events. \r\n",
      "A 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck on March 11, 2011, off the Japanese coast, triggering a tsunami that killed some 18,000 people and the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. Meltdowns at three of the Fukushima Daiichi plant’s six reactors spewed radiation into the air, soil and ocean, forcing over 100,000 residents to flee. Many have still not returned. \r\n",
      "The Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) is currently collaborating with British researchers to learn more about the state of the radioactive particles created by the meltdown. \r\n",
      "Dr Yukihiko Satou from the JAEA oversaw the transportation of particles collected from within the restricted zone, very close to the disaster site, to Britain. \r\n",
      "“The particles were fundamentally extracted from those attached to soil, dust and debris,” Satou told Reuters. \r\n",
      "Encased in protective tape, the samples were brought to the Diamond Light Source, Britain’s national synchrotron, or cyclic particle accelerator, near Oxford. \r\n",
      "Here electrons are accelerated to near light speeds until they emit light 10 billion times brighter than the sun, then directed into laboratories in ‘beamlines’ which allow scientists to study minute specimens in extreme detail. \r\n",
      "Researchers have created a 3D map of a radioactive sample using the synchrotron, allowing them to see the distribution of elements within the sample. \r\n",
      "Understanding the current state of these particles and how they behave in the environment could ultimately determine if and when the area could be declared safe for people to return. \r\n",
      "The head of the team leading the analysis, Tom Scott of Bristol University, said the particles have a structure like a pumice, a very light, porous volcanic rock. \r\n",
      "“Studying... this glassy matrix tells us how available within the environment they are,” he said. \r\n",
      "The British and Japanese governments have awarded funding to the research team to examine larger particles closer to the site of the meltdown at Fukushima to better define radiation risk in the surrounding area. \r\n",
      "The research could have significance beyond nuclear accidents, the team said, because the techniques employed could also be used to image particles in air pollution to better understand the risk they pose to human health. \r\n",

      "Content:  157 TOKYO (Reuters) - Early in December, dozens of journalists and editors from the Japan Times gathered for an emergency meeting in a glass-walled conference room in their brand-new 14th floor office. \r\n",
      "On the agenda was a single, incendiary issue: the newspaper’s new descriptions of how Japan compelled thousands of foreigners into military brothels and labor during World War Two. \r\n",
      "In the past, the Japan Times described Korean workers as “forced laborers” and comfort women as those “forced to provide sex for Japanese troops before and during World War II.” \r\n",
      "But the five-sentence note published on Nov. 30 said the country’s oldest English-language paper would refer to Korean workers simply as “wartime laborers.” \r\n",
      "The paper also said that because of the varied experiences of comfort women, it would describe them as “women who worked in wartime brothels, including those who did so against their will.” \r\n",
      "Such terms are social flashpoints in Japan and a topic of bitter dispute with South Korea, whose government argues comfort women were clear victims of wartime abuse. \r\n",
      "The changes come amid simmering tensions; South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled in October that Japanese companies must compensate South Koreans forced to work during the war. \r\n",
      "The executive editor of the Japan Times, Hiroyasu Mizuno, told staff in the December meeting that he had two goals: to avoid creating the perception the paper was “anti-Japanese,” and to increase advertising revenue from Japanese companies and institutions. \r\n",
      "Some readers said the change glossed over Japan’s wartime actions. \r\n",
      "Prominent Japanese conservatives, meanwhile, applauded the move, calling it a coup for nationalist activists agitating for English-language news outlets to change such descriptions. \r\n",
      "In an email, Mizuno told Reuters he and senior editorial managers decided to revise the paper’s descriptions to “better reflect a more objective view of topics that are both contentious and difficult to summarize.” \r\n",
      "He said the Nov. 30 note did not signal a change in the paper’s editorial direction, adding: “I categorically deny any accusations that The Japan Times has bowed to external pressure.” \r\n",
      "The Japan Times has an outsized impact on how the country is perceived abroad - it is distributed in Japan with The New York Times - and is seen domestically as an unofficial style guide for other English-language outlets. \r\n",
      "A New York Times representative said that the editorial operations of the two organizations were separate, and that the paper used precise language on the topic and would continue to do so. \r\n",
      "Reuters interviews with nearly a dozen Japan Times employees - all of whom requested anonymity out of fear of reprisal - along with hundreds of pages of internal emails and presentation materials, show the editorial changes started taking shape when the paper changed hands in June 2017. \r\n",
      "‘ANTI-JAPANESE’ \r\n",
      "Some media critics say self-censorship is a problem in Japanese newsrooms, fed by fear of losing access, advertising revenue and subscribers. \r\n",
      "In the past, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his top aide, Yoshihide Suga, have singled out the liberal Asahi Shimbun for criticism, including over its articles on comfort women and the Fukushima disaster, some of which it later retracted, citing errors. \r\n",
      "Suga told Reuters the government would not comment on media companies’ editorial policies, including those of the Japan Times. \r\n",
      "Conservative groups in Japan have pushed hard to change how Japan’s World War Two activities are described. \r\n",
      "For instance, an Australian-Japanese organization that protests comfort women statues, saying the monuments feed anti-Japanese sentiment, along with Kent Gilbert, a well-known conservative commentator and lawyer who has worked in Japan for decades, petitioned Asahi Shimbun last year to remove “forced” from its description of comfort women. \r\n",
      "The paper did not amend its wording, saying in a public statement that it took care “to use the most appropriate phrasing” for stories. \r\n",
      "Similar pressure led the conservative Yomiuri Shimbun to apologize to readers in 2014 for using “sex slaves” to refer to comfort women in its English-language edition. \r\n",
      "“The Yomiuri Shimbun apologizes for having used these misleading expressions,” the paper’s English site said in a statement at the time. \r\n",
      "The chilling effect in newsrooms often comes from within the organization, experts say. \r\n",
      "“It’s less a result of direct government pressure and more from people inside newsrooms looking to their superiors and the public,” said Minako Beppu, a journalism professor at Hosei University who studies media censorship. “It’s things like, ‘Let’s not criticize them too much,’ or ‘Let’s tone things down a bit.’” \r\n",
      "At the Dec. 3 staff meeting, Mizuno said the changes were not political. \r\n",
      "“I want to get rid of criticism that Japan Times is anti-Japanese,” he said, according to a transcript and audio recording. \r\n",
      "He added that the decision would attract advertising. A senior manager in charge of sponsored content then said the paper had already increased government ad sales and scored an exclusive interview with Abe after dropping a column by Jeff Kingston, director of Asia studies at Temple University Japan, who had been writing weekly on what he saw as the Abe administration’s historical revisionism. \r\n",
      "“From a journalistic standpoint, that’s fatal, really,” a senior Japan Times reporter responded, according to the transcript. \r\n",
      "A senior South Korean foreign ministry official declined to comment on the Japan Times. \r\n",
      "In December, Reuters received a letter from a Japanese government official objecting to the term “sex slave” in a Nov. 22 article about South Korean comfort women. \r\n",
      "Reuters removed the term because the wording breached the agency's stylebook guidance on \"comfort women.\"(here\r\n",
      "NEW MASTERS \r\n",
      "Founded in 1897, the Japan Times has a circulation of just 45,000. \r\n",
      "After years of losses and the death of its previous owner, the paper - published under the banner “All the news without fear or favor” - was sold in 2017 to News2u, a PR company. \r\n",
      "It’s not unusual in Japan for new management to shift a paper’s editorial stance, and readers may miss subtle changes. \r\n",
      "But a few months after the sale, some longtime contributors, including Kingston, were told their regular columns were being cut. \r\n",
      "“I got an email out of the blue saying, ‘We’re terminating your column,’” Kingston said. \r\n",
      "Mizuno said the paper was open to future submissions from Kingston, but did not say why the column was canceled. \r\n",
      "“We have retained commentary writers and columnists that are, when appropriate, critical of the Japanese government,” he said in an email. \r\n",
      "Several reporters also said they felt more editorial pressure. \r\n",
      "In August 2017, when a local newspaper reported that Tokyo’s governor would snub an annual memorial for Koreans killed by mobs after an earthquake in 1923, reporters rushed to cover the news. But the reporters said they were particularly shocked when, in an email seen by Reuters, Mizuno told staff, “I think there is absolutely no value for us to report on this.” \r\n",
      "A SWIFT CHANGE \r\n",
      "A few months after the paper’s exclusive sit-down with Abe in February, Mizuno tried to revise the paper’s style on comfort women and other sensitive topics, presenting editors with more than 100 meticulously annotated articles and columns. \r\n",
      "In the notes, seen by Reuters, Mizuno objected to calling comfort women “victims” or mentioning that they included girls; questioned referring to Japan’s occupation of Korea as “brutal”; and criticized the paper’s reporting and stories by wire services, including Reuters, as generally “pro-Korea” and not adequately reflecting Japan’s view. \r\n",
      "“We’re not historians or arbiters of history, nor are we judges,” he wrote. \r\n",
      "Ultimately, he failed to persuade others, and the matter was put on hold. \r\n",
      "But the South Korean court ruling in October led to a swift denunciation from the Japanese government and a flurry of coverage. \r\n",
      "Mizuno turned to senior managers and the board of directors to make broader changes, according to Japan Times employees. \r\n",
      "Around the same time, the ultra-conservative think tank Japan Institute for National Fundamentals called on English-language media and specifically the Japan Times to refer to plaintiffs in the Seoul case as “wartime Korean workers,” leaving out references to coercion. \r\n",

      "“I want to give the message to the person who did this, or if he has any friends who also think like this: I still love you,” Farid said. “I want to hug you and I want to tell him in face that I am talking from my heart.

      "Content:  163 Tokyo -- The operator of the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant began removing fuel Monday from a cooling pool at one of three reactors that melted down in the 2011 disaster, a milestone in what will be a decades-long process to decommission the facility. Tokyo Electric Power Co. said workers started removing the first of 566 used and unused fuel units stored in the pool at Unit 3. \r\n",
      "The fuel units in the pool located high up in reactor buildings are intact despite the disaster, but the pools are not enclosed, so removing the units to safer ground is crucial to avoid disaster in case of another major earthquake similar to the one that caused the 2011 tsunami.\r\n",
      "TEPCO says the removal at Unit 3 will take two years, followed by the two other reactors, where about 1,000 fuel units remain in the storage pools.\r\n",
      "The removal process\r\n",
      "Removing fuel units from the cooling pools comes ahead of the real challenge of removing melted fuel from inside the reactors, but details of how that might be done are still largely unknown. Removing the fuel in the cooling pools was delayed more than four years by mishaps, high radiation and radioactive debris from an explosion that occurred at the time of the reactor meltdowns, underscoring the difficulties that remain.\r\n",
      "Fukushima's ghost towns\r\n",
      "Workers are remotely operating a crane built underneath a jelly roll-shaped roof cover to raise the fuel from a storage rack in the pool and place it into a protective cask. The whole process occurs underwater to prevent radiation leaks. Each cask will be filled with seven fuel units, then lifted from the pool and lowered to a truck that will transport the cask to a safer cooling pool elsewhere at the plant.\r\n",
      "The work is carried out remotely from a control room about 500 yards away because of still-high radiation levels inside the reactor building that houses the pool.\r\n",
      "\"I believe everything is going well so far,\" plant chief Tomohiko Isogai told Japanese public broadcaster NHK. \"We will watch the progress at the site as we put safety first. Our goal is not to rush the process but to carefully proceed with the decommissioning work.\"\r\n",
      "About an hour after the work began Monday, the first fuel unit was safely stored inside the cask, TEPCO spokesman Takahiro Kimoto said. Monday's operation was to end after a fourth unit is placed inside the cask, he said. No major damage was found on the fuel unit Monday, but plant officials will closely examine if there are any pinholes or other irregularities, Kimoto said.\r\n",
      "800 tons of melted nuclear fuel\r\n",
      "Robotic probes have photographed and detected traces of damaged nuclear fuel in the three reactors that had meltdowns, but the exact location and other details of the melted fuel are largely unknown. \r\n",
      "Robot probes Fukushima nuclear reactor for melted fuel\r\n",
      "Removing fuel from the cooling pools will help free up space for the subsequent removal of the melted fuel, though details on how to gain access to it have yet to be decided.\r\n",
      "Experts say the melted fuel in the three reactors amounts to more than 800 tons, an enormous amount that is more than six times that of the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island, where one reactor had a partial core melt.\r\n",
      "In February, a remote-controlled robot with tongs removed pebbles of nuclear debris from the Unit 2 reactor but was unable to remove larger chunks, indicating a robot would need to be developed that can break the chunks into smaller pieces. Toshiba Corp.'s energy systems unit, which developed the robot, said the findings were key to determining the proper equipment and technologies needed to remove the melted fuel, the most challenging part of the decommissioning.\r\n",
      "TEPCO and government officials plan to determine methods for removing the melted fuel from each of the three damaged reactors later this year so they can begin the process in 2021.\n",

      "Content:  183 The site of the only ground campaign waged in North America during World War II, the remote Alaskan island of Attu is the western most point of the United States. Its barren landscape is challenging. Its hostile weather was as much of an enemy to American troops as was the Japanese Imperial Army. The Battle of Attu was one of the most brutal of the entire war—and filming there came with its own set of challenges.  \r\n",
      "To begin with, when 60 Minutes producer Draggan Mihailovich left New York City to film on Attu for the broadcast this week, there was no guarantee he and his crew would actually get there. \r\n",
      "The crew first had to get to Anchorage, where they found an aviation company that agreed to fly a four-seater plane to the uninhabited island. Along with a pilot, that left enough room for Mihailovich, cameraman Chris Everson, and author Mark Obmascik, who wrote a book about the Battle of Attu, which is published by CBS's Simon &amp; Schuster.\r\n",
      "Together, they then had to make other stops along the way—first Cold Bay, then Adak. The plan was to spend the night on Adak, which is about 400 miles from Attu, then attempt a flight to Attu the next morning. But once on Adak, pilot Jeff McMillan got word that the barometric pressure was expected to drop shortly. \"We've got a two-hour window where we can land on Attu,\" he told Mihailovich. At the intersection of the warm Pacific Ocean currents and the frigid Bering Sea, Attu is typically coated in a thick layer of fog, making it possible for pilots to locate the airstrip only a dozen days a year. Because the island also sits along the Pacific Ocean's Ring of Fire, an earthquake could have splintered the ground since the last time anyone had visited. So McMillan and the three others took off, not knowing if their plane could land.\r\n",
      "The only way to get to Attu was a four-seater plane, so the 60 Minutes crew had to make several stops on the 1,500-mile trip from Anchorage. When they left Adak, they didn't know whether or not they would be able to land on Attu.\r\n",
      "As they approached the island, the dense fog suddenly parted. Attu and her mountains came into view. After McMillan safely landed the plane, he told Mihailovich he had been half a mile away from turning around and giving up.\r\n",
      "Once on Attu, the crew didn't know when the island's erratic weather would allow them to leave. Although they had planned to spend four days filming, they packed enough provisions for an extra week. McMillan had to stay on Attu, in case he was unable to return. He had to tie down his aircraft because Attu experiences hurricane-force winds called williwaws that can reach 80-100 mph.\r\n",
      "That wind was just about the only other inhabitant on the island. There is no electricity, no semblance of civilization. There are no trees, no roads, nor vehicles that would drive on them. There is only a powerful gust that rattled the crew's tents at night. \r\n",
      "Each day the group had to carry everything they would need for the miles-long walk to filming locations: food, a tripod, a camera, extra batteries, first aid supplies to tend to a wound. If something more serious were to happen, say a broken ankle while trying to ford a river on foot, no help would arrive.\r\n",
      "\"It's the strangest sensation in the world,\" Mihailovich said in the video above. \"You don't hear cars honking. There are no planes flying overhead. All you hear are the birds and the wind.\" \r\n",
      "Because there are no roads and no vehicles on Attu, the crew had to carry everything they needed each day.\r\n",
      "But as the crew made their way around the island, they began to see the vestiges of war: a few rusted weapons, an ammunition shed high up on a hill, foxholes like scabs on the mountain.\r\n",
      "Obmascik, an expert on the Battle of Attu, said U.S. troops were unprepared for what they found when they invaded the island in May 1943, 11 months after the Japanese had arrived. \r\n",
      "\"I think that the U.S. generals went in and thought that they were going to be fighting a garrison of maybe 3,000 Japanese,\" he said. \"Instead, they had to fight Attu. \r\n",
      "The Americans couldn't build roads because the soil was like taffy. On the beach, the sand was spongey; troops would get stuck when they walked. \r\n",
      "\"They had no way to run supply lines,\" Obmascik said. \"And so they had long lines of hundreds of men who would have to pass gear up from man to man to move it up the mountain to fight.\" \r\n",
      "AP\r\n",
      "AP\r\n",
      "More than 500 Americans were killed in the Battle of Attu.\r\n",
      "The troops sent to Attu had been preparing for desert warfare, so their thin boots were more suited for logging in Oregon than for going through four-foot snow drifts, Obmascik said. The boots couldn't be dried. The fog was so thick they couldn't see; the mud was so sticky they couldn't walk. The weather was so cold they couldn't sleep, and their feet were swollen with trench foot.\r\n",
      "Of the 11,000 Americans sent to recapture Attu, 549 were killed. More than 3,000 were wounded, either by enemy fire or by Attu's harsh weather. \r\n",
      "\"As you walked around, and you see this spectacularly beautiful place, there's a little bit of melancholy that sets in,\" Mihailovich said, \"because you know how many people who lost their lives, you know how many kids grew up not knowing their dads. And that gives you pause.\" \r\n",

      "Content:  197 (CNN)The Bureau of Land Management has shuttered much of its agency's functions during the government shutdown, but in its Alaska office, the agency used leftover funds from the past year to hold public meetings over the past week regarding an agency plan that would make Arctic land available for oil and gas leasing purchases. \r\n",
      "The Bureau of Land Management is part of the Interior Department, which has been closed since Dec. 22.\r\n",
      "The meetings took place Friday, Saturday and Wednesday in different cities across the state -- the last one was on day 19 of the government shutdown. A meeting scheduled for Thursday was postponed due to \"weather conditions,\" according to a tweet from BLM Alaska.\r\n",
      "The Bureau of Land Management's Alaska office publicized the meetings on its Facebook page. \r\n",
      "In a letter to the Interior Department, House Natural Resources Chairman Raul Grijalva criticized its decision to move forward with the meetings during a shutdown. He also commented that stakeholders were informed only the day before that the meetings would take place.\r\n",
      "\"Asking people to comment on two major development processes in the Arctic with huge potential environmental and human consequences without anyone in the agency able to answer questions defeats the purpose of the public participation process,\" the Arizona Democrat wrote. \r\n",
      "Grijalva wrote that the \"responsible and fair course of action\" would be to reschedule the public meetings. \r\n",
      "The agency's shutdown plan says BLM functions will cease except for \"law enforcement, emergency response functions, and operations necessary for the safety of human life or the protection of property.\"\r\n",
      "Out of over 9,000 employees, 1,530 BLM employees are exempt and required to continue working without pay -- 524 in full-time status and 1,006 on call. The plan names some of the offices that exempt employees work in, including staff \"in Alaska working on the administration and regulation of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.\" \r\n",
      "The BLM Alaska office used carryover oil and gas appropriation funds from the past year to continue work related to the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. The meetings were initially scheduled for the first week of December, but due to the earthquake in Anchorage on November 30, they were postponed until January, according to a BLM spokesperson. \r\n",
      "The agency issued a notice of intent to prepare an integrated activity plan and environmental impact statement for the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska at the end of November. In order to submit those plans, the agency is first required to hold a series of public meetings and have a public comment period. \r\n",
      "The comment period on the action closes on January 22. \r\n",
      "The plan and environmental impact statement would \"ensure that BLM's land management will provide the opportunity ... to construct pipelines and other necessary infrastructure to bring oil and gas resources from offshore or adjacent leases to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System or a future gas pipeline,\" according to the agency's notice.\r\n",
      "Grijalva's letter requests information from the department about what funds were used for the meetings, what funds BLM had at the beginning of the shutdown and how those funds are being spent.\n",

      "Surveillance footage shows the car flying over the curb of the girl's front lawn in Lithonia, Georgia, near Atlanta. LaDerihanna starts to sprint, but she couldn't outrun the careening car as it crashes into her and then into her house. \r\n",

      "Bolton said even she felt the impact of the crash from inside the house. \r\n",

Chris Stewart, who is representing the girl's family. \"He's caught on camera taking part in this horrific situation that turned into a miracle for this child. I've just never seen anything like this in my entire career.\" \r\n",
      "It's also a small miracle that the family had security footage capturing both the crash and the back side of a man who fled the car.\r\n",
      "The idea for the camera stemmed from a theft at the home. \r\n",
      "\"Someone had (stolen) my son's bicycle out of the front yard, and my husband said, 'I'm going to get cameras for the house,' \" Bolton said. \r\n",

      "\"And I told him, 'We need those cameras back running.' And if it wasn't for that, we wouldn't have anything,\" she said. \r\n",
      "The family decided to publicize the video in hopes that someone can identify the driver. In addition to leaving LaDerihanna critically injured, he also severely damaged the family's home. \r\n",
      "\"This car is deep in my house,\" Bolton said. \"My basement is destroyed.\"\r\n",
      "While the manhunt continues, LaDerihanna is trying to stay positive as she recovers from her extensive injuries. \r\n",

      "Bolton said the family is grateful for the \"wide outpouring of love and support all across the world.\"\r\n",

      "Content:  203 MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia’s Oil Search is confident its partners ExxonMobil Corp and Total SA will be ready to sign off on two big projects in 2020 that together will double liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from Papua New Guinea. \r\n",
      "Oil Search had first hoped the projects to fuel an expansion of Exxon Mobil’s PNG LNG plant would be approved in 2019, but talks with the government took longer than expected after an earthquake hit the country a year ago. \r\n",
      "“It was a very tough year in Papua New Guinea for a range of reasons and it started with the earthquake,” Oil Search Chief Executive Peter Botten said. \r\n",
      "The quake killed more than 100 people in the rugged highlands region of one of the world’s poorest countries, destroyed homes, roads and runways and knocked out gas and oil facilities. \r\n",
      "It also stoked long-running antagonism against the PNG LNG project, as the country’s take from the development has been much lower than anticipated and the government has been slow to pay out royalties to local communities. \r\n",
      "Some people even blamed oil and gas operations for triggering the quake. \r\n",
      "“In that context, we were doing a lot of negotiations on major projects and those sensitivities, I think, have been really well addressed,” Botten told Reuters after the company reported its annual results. \r\n",
      "Total is set to sign an agreement with the government by early April on its Papua LNG project, and Exxon Mobil is expected to follow soon after on terms for an expansion of its PNG LNG plant and development of a new gas field, P’nyang, Botten said. \r\n",
      "Total’s Elk and Antelope fields, new gas from PNG LNG fields and P’nyang are set to feed gas into three new processing units at PNG LNG, roughly doubling its output to 16 million tonnes a year, at a cost of around $13 billion, according to analysts. \r\n",
      "“I’m very confident that a 2020 final investment decision is very achievable,” Botten said. \r\n",
      "Oil Search, which has a 29 percent stake in the PNG LNG project, posted a 13 percent rise in annual profit, boosted by higher prices for its LNG and oil, which offset a loss of output after the earthquake. \r\n",
      "Net profit for the year ended Dec. 31 rose to $341.2 million from $302.1 million a year earlier, but fell short of analysts’ forecasts around $360.83 million, according to Refinitiv data. \r\n",

      "Content:  204 With no end in sight to the longest shutdown in American history, furloughed government worker John Sprinkle and his family are postponing all manner of spending.\r\n",
      "At this time of year, Sprinkle and his wife would normally be planning their summer vacation. Not now. Sprinkle is about to miss his second paycheck since the partial government shutdown began just before Christmas. With hundreds of thousands of other government workers and contractors in the same situation, those cutbacks are likely to ripple across the economy.\r\n",
      "\"We were thinking of getting a new computer, but that's not going to happen,\" he said. \"We're not really eating out like we normally would be. We are not going out to events like we would be.\"\r\n",
      "The shutdown's biggest effect on the economy is likely to be the cutback in federal spending. But consumer spending, which is critical to growth, is another important factor. Because about 4 million private-sector workers depend on the federal government, the shutdown's effects could double the economic damage, Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, wrote in a research note earlier this month.\r\n",
      "\"The more lasting damage could come from the long-term negative effects on confidence, especially among consumers,\" McMillan noted, citing a drop in the University of Michigan consumer confidence index this month. \"If this drop persists or gets worse, the risk of a deeper economic slowdown gets substantially higher.\"\r\n",
      "On Thursday, President Donald Trump tweeted that the economy \"is doing great.\" Kevin Hassett, the top economic adviser to the White House, yesterday said he sees the economy grinding to a halt if the partial government shutdown continues much longer.\r\n",
      "The economy is doing great. More people working in U.S.A. today than at any time in our HISTORY. Media barely covers! @foxandfriends\r\n",
      "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2019\r\n",
      "Stores and restaurants\r\n",
      "When government employees spend less, stores and restaurants that serve them suffer. So do landlords and lenders that do business with federal workers. Though spending and growth will rebound once the government reopens, most of the restaurant meals missed and hotel stays canceled will never be made up.\r\n",
      "\"Creditors and suppliers hit by the shutdown will become less patient if it drags on,\" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a research note. \"People and businesses are being hurt by the shutdown, and the pain will intensify.\"\r\n",
      "If the shutdown drags on through March, annual economic growth could fall to zero in the first three months of the year. Even if the government reopens by the end of the month, the annual pace of growth could be a meager 1.6 percent — only half the pace of last quarter, said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.\r\n",

      "Brian Snyder / Reuters\r\n",
      "Hassett, the White House economist, acknowledged in an interview on CNN that growth could be flat in the first quarter, though Hassett suggested that a \"humongous\" rebound would follow. Yet some independent economists doubt that the rebound would be enough to offset the initial damage. The economy is already bedeviled by slowing global growth, ongoing trade tensions and higher interest rates, which contributed to a plunge in home sales last month.\r\n",
      "Slower rebound?\r\n",
      "Bernard Baumohl, chief economist at the Economic Outlook Group, suggested that once the government reopened, many households would focus on repaying credit card debt and restoring lost savings — trends that would slow the rebound.\r\n",
      "For now, there are hints that the shutdown is slowing retail sales. A measure of weekly chain store sales fell 1.3 percent last week, its second straight drop. Cold weather likely contributed to the fall, said Michael Niemira, chief economist at the consulting firm Retail Economist, but the shutdown may also have contributed.\r\n",
      "It's hard to know just how much the shutdown is depressing consumer spending because the Commerce Department, which compiles and reports such data, was itself closed by the shutdown.\r\n",
      "Anecdotal evidence, though, suggests that the trend is spreading. Even federal workers with solid finances are holding back. Sprinkle, who lives in Alexandria, Virginia, knows he will eventually be paid, and his wife is still earning a paycheck. Their two children are out of the house, in college, and he knows he could borrow against his home equity if he had to.\r\n",
      "Still, \"the effect is more psychological,\" he said.\r\n",
      "Waiving fees\r\n",
      "The shutdown began on the day of his 20th anniversary working for the National Park Service, where he is now a historian. His Mac computer is roughly eight years old and will no longer update with the latest operating software. But he is postponing a replacement.\r\n",
      "The impact of the shutdown is evident beyond Washington. Officials in New Orleans announced Wednesday that they are waiving late fees for federal workers who have fallen behind on their property taxes.\r\n",
      "Also Wednesday, in Philadelphia, a hunger relief organization set up a market for furloughed federal workers under an Interstate 95 overpass. Stefanie Arck-Baynes, a spokeswoman for the group, Philabundance, said they had expected 150 to 300 people. But by 11 a.m., they had already served 300, and the lines were growing.\r\n",
      "The organization extended the hour-long event to meet demand. Tables were set up with lines of fresh produce, bread, milk and canned goods.\r\n",
      "It was the first time the group had offered an \"emergency food response\" in Philadelphia in its 35-year history, Arck-Baynes said.\r\n",

      "Content:  205 (Reuters) - Vale SA said on Monday that a Brazilian state court has ordered it to stop using eight tailings dams in the wake of a disaster last month that likely killed more than 300 people, a step that will crimp nearly 9 percent of the company’s annual iron ore output. \r\n",
      "The move is the first step by Brazilian officials to limit production by the world’s largest iron ore miner since the disaster, which has sparked global outcry over common mining practices that many now are decrying as unsafe. \r\n",
      "Shares of Vale fell 4 percent on Monday before trading was halted. \r\n",
      "With 134 people confirmed dead and another 199 still missing, according to the latest tally on Monday, the Brumadinho dam burst could be Brazil’s deadliest mine disaster on record. \r\n",
      "Vale said in a securities filing that a court in the state of Minas Gerais ordered it to stop using three upstream tailings dams, like the Brumadinho dam that burst last week, which were already inactive. \r\n",
      "The ruling also halted use of the Laranjeiras dam at the Brucutu mine, which does not use the upstream model, affecting production of about 30 million tonnes of iron ore output per year - nearly 9 percent the company’s annual output. \r\n",
      "The Laranjeiras tailings dam is a conventional design, which is built vertically over time. It is typically safer than an upstream design, which is built higher and leans into the waste it is meant to contain. \r\n",
      "By extending the ban to a different type of tailings dam design - one considered safer by many engineers - Brazilian officials seemed keen to move quickly to reassure an anxious public. \r\n",
      "Of the three main tailings dams designs common in the mining industry, the upstream design is the cheapest but also the least safe. \r\n",
      "Vale implied it may challenge the decision, saying it will adopt “appropriate legal measures.” \r\n",
      "Chile, Peru and other earthquake-prone countries ban the design, in which tailings are used to progressively construct dam walls the more a mine is excavated. Brazil is not as earthquake-prone as its western neighbors, but even small seismic activity has been shown to affect tailings dams. \r\n",
      "The move is not expected to affect Vale’s overall production as it already produces an excess of the market’s current needs. Still, analysts expect it to have a rippling effect. \r\n",
      "“This is likely to unnerve iron ore markets further,” analyst at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a note to clients. \r\n",

      "Content:  206 With the partial government shutdown poised to become the longest in history, federal workers outside the greater D.C. area have a message for Washington: The funding lapse is creating real problems and, in some cases, hurting security interests. \r\n",
      "The partial shutdown, which affects funding for the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the State Department, the IRS and other key agencies, is forcing roughly 420,000 federal employees to work without pay, and another roughly 380,000 to be furloughed. President Trump has threatened to declare a national emergency to fund his border wall, and potentially end the shutdown stalemate, as reaching a deal with Congress looks less and less likely. \r\n",
      "Most affected federal employees missed their first paycheck Friday. \r\n",
      "\"I wish they would understand we're not all living in the Beltway,\" said Forrest Lanning, a Federal Emergency Management Agency earthquake and volcano program manager based in California. \r\n",
      "Lanning has spent recent weeks in Paradise, Calif., responding to the deadly fire there that has left dozens dead. He was scheduled to help with FEMA-funded permanent housing construction on the Northern Mariana Islands, but that trip has been delayed indefinitely as the shutdown lingers. \r\n",
      "Lanning says the shutdown isn't significantly affecting disaster response — at least, not yet — but it is destroying the morale of FEMA responders continuing to help with disasters without pay, he said, and there has been some confusion within the agency as to what expenses the agency is able to cover during the shutdown. Lanning said he can work without pay for one paycheck, but past that, \"then I really have to start digging.\" \r\n",
      "\"It's probably not affecting the ability to respond to disaster because the people who are required to work do work are working, but it does destroy the morale,\" Lanning said. \r\n",
      "\"We're kind of the face of the government out here, and any bad news on the news is coming back to us,\" he added. \r\n",

      "One Coast Guard aviator based on the North Carolina coast said he doesn't understand how allowing DHS to go without funding promotes security. His pay stub Friday was $0.00.\r\n",
      "\"My wife and I are alright financially for a couple paychecks, but after that it's not looking very good,\" said the aviator, who is not identified because he said he's not supposed to express political views as a Coast Guard employee. \r\n",
      "\"I'm also getting called back into work next work as an essential personnel, so I will be working without getting paid. I don't understand shutting down the Department of Homeland Security, which looks out for our borders and country. I help keep the helicopters of the coast guard flying for the Coast Guard to do their duty — for free.\"\r\n",
      "The aviator was hoping to find other work while the shutdown drags on, but was notified he was moved to essential personnel and has had to work 10-hour days this week, making it nearly impossible to find another source of income. He and his wife, with a one-year-old child, have been living with his parents as they fix up their house to sell it, but those plans have been put on hold for now. \r\n",

      "Eric Young worked for the Bureau of Prisons for 21 years, and now represents roughly 33,000 federal Bureau of Prison employees. Young said failing to pay correctional officers responsible for custody of roughly 151,700 federal inmates, some of whom are convicted of rape and murder, makes no sense. \r\n",
      "\"That's what's been frustrating for many of our colleagues,\" Young said. \"We've got the president that many of my colleagues voted for under the auspices that he was going to be a law and order president. Well, I'm telling everybody you can't have law and order without the Bureau of Prisons.\"\r\n",
      "\"Here you want a wall on the outside but you're not worried about the inside,\" Young added.\r\n",
      "Federal prisons were already short-staffed before the shutdown began, he said, and now, \"There's no room for someone not showing up.\" Federal correctional officers make between $26,000 and $61,000, and most of the federal prisons are in Middle America, Young noted. \r\n",
      "Young is trying to persuade some of the hardest-hit employees, like a husband and wife who are both federal correctional officers and have a severely handicapped son who lives on a ventilator, to speak on the record. \r\n",

She is an excepted employee, meaning she's expected to work. \r\n",
      "But her father recently died, and as his only child, she has had to take time off to arrange his estate. The forecaster said she's grateful to be able to help her family, but the stress is taking its toll. \r\n",

      "\"As scared and precarious as we may be, there are people that I know that are much worse off,\" she said. \"I'm trying to find ways to help those friends, too.\" \r\n",
      "What's next?\r\n",
      "It's unclear exactly where the shutdown stalemate ends. The president said Thursday he will \"probably\" and perhaps \"100 percent\" declare a national emergency to fund his border wall if Congress can't reach an agreement on his border wall. Even if he does declare a national emergency, Congress still has to pass legislation to reopen the federal government, and the next federal paycheck wouldn't be for another two weeks. \r\n",
      "The Senate and House have voted to provide back pay to federal employees after the shutdown ends, and that bill heads to Mr. Trump for his signature. \r\n",

      "Content:  213 The Turkish opposition had a historic night March 31, when President Recep Tayyip Erdogans party surprisingly failed to win the mayoral races in Ankara, the capital, and Istanbul, the financial capital. Exactly 25 years ago, Erdogan became Istanbuls mayor and the parties he supported hadnt lost either city since.\r\n",
      "But will Erdogan accept the results? Its unclear. The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still pushing for a ballot recount even asking for new elections in three months in various districts. However, the election night performance of the opposition candidates in these two major cities was enough to create a huge hope among opposition supporters for the future of Turkish democracy, which collapsed two years ago.\r\n",
      "Millions of Turks are reenergized politically\r\n",
      "They see how a 49-year-old mayoral candidate, Ekrem Imamoglu, organized thousands of party volunteers to oversee ballot boxes in Istanbul and to systematically report the results to the partys headquarters. Imamoglu held hourly news conferences on election night and well into the following morning to share updates based on the party network. He was also vocal about election violations by the electoral commission and the state-run news agency.\r\n",
      "What does this mean in a broader perspective? \r\n",
      "While the ruling coalition failed to win Ankara and Istanbul, it did not lose much support overall in the nation, compared with last years general-election results. The total vote support for the governing parties was about 54 percent in 2018, while it is now about 52 percent.\r\n",
      "If we look at the past 10 to 15 years, the AKP tends to lose significant votes in local elections and recover them in the next general election. In 2007, the AKP got 47 percent in the general election and then lost 5 percent in the 2009 local elections but in 2011s general elections, the party hit 50 percent.\r\n",
      "This was followed by a 12 percent decline in the 2014 elections. But again, the AKP managed to recover back to 50 percent support for November 2015s general election.\r\n",
      "In that light, the two-percentage-point difference between the 2018 general-election and 2019 local election results appears to be following a pattern and it is less likely that this latest election was an earthquake for the AKP.\r\n",
      "The oppositions empowerment would definitely strengthen Turkish democracy, but it is not very plausible to suggest that the AKP is in a declining trend, simply looking at the political atmosphere in todays Turkey.\r\n",
      "They are the lame ducks\r\n",
      "Erdogan is a smart politician who can easily find new agenda topics that can rally people around his partys flag. For example, after the 2009 local elections, he did this by fighting hardcore secularists, while after the 2014 elections, he targeted Kurds and the followers of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Erdogan accused of being behind a 2016 coup attempt.\r\n",
      "Even if the opposition candidates manage to sit in the mayoral offices in these major cities, they will be challenged because of the institutional and political structure. The ruling coalition is still powerful in the metropolitan councils. As Erdogan remarked to a party supporter who complained about the results in Istanbul: Do not worry, we have the majority in the council. Nothing is certain yet. They are the lame ducks, even if they win the race.\r\n",
      "More recently, he said they have at least 40 more seats in local councils in Istanbul and Ankara than does the entire opposition and an opposition mayor will not be able to pass even a budget without cooperating with the council majority. Erdogan can also enact new laws to give even more powers to the local councils vis-a-vis the mayors.\r\n",
      "Considering that Erdogans government has extensive control over the countrys judiciary and its media, the incoming mayors will face challenges, including heightened auditing from various central-government agencies and close media attention.\r\n",
      "If the opposition cannot find alternative communication tools to express what it is able to do and what it is not allowed to do in office its performance could lead to massive disappointments over the next few years.\r\n",
      "A new law gives the president full authority to allocate funds directly to the municipalities he selects. Given the heightened financial crisis Turkey has been dealing with over the past year, this helps pro-government mayors. In case of worsening economic conditions, pro-opposition mayors may be the ones who suffer most over the next few years, and the public will totally be unaware of what is happening behind the scenes.\r\n",
      "A PR opportunity for Erdogan\r\n",
      "While the political atmosphere in Turkey gave some hope to the opposition, it also turned out to be a large-scale PR opportunity for the ruling party. If Erdogan accepts the election results, Turkeys democracy ranking will to some extent improve.\r\n",
      "If this decision is accompanied by some improvements on the rule of law and free-market economics, Erdogan will have an advantage in his fight against the countrys financial problems, as Turkey will be able to attract more foreign investors and keep its own highly skilled professionals and wealthy elites, who have been migrating abroad. Erdogan largely stressed the free-market economy as his urgent policy priority during his election night speech.\r\n",
      "Considering the massive resources these two metropolitan areas control and the established patronage networks in these cities, it is not an easy decision for the government. However, despite the fact that the 2019 local election campaigns were some of the most unfair in modern Turkish history, the AKP and Erdogan can attempt to change their image in the eyes of foreign observers and global financial centers by recognizing the opposition mayors. Such a decision would eventually strengthen the governments leverage in potential International Monetary Fund negotiations, which many argue are inevitable for Turkey.\r\n",

      "Content:  214 (Reuters) - Australia’s Oil Search, France’s Total SA and Exxon Mobil on Tuesday signed a deal with Papua New Guinea that will allow work to start on a long-awaited project which could help double the nation’s liquefied natural gas exports. \r\n",
      "Oil Search said in a statement that the agreement would allow the parties to start activities related to so-called Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) such as contractor selection for Papua LNG - a project led by Total, with Exxon and Oil Search as minority partners. \r\n",
      "“FEED is expected to result in a Final Investment Decision in 2020, which will ensure that first production from ... LNG trains is available in 2024,” said Oil Search’s managing director, Peter Botten. \r\n",
      "Oil Search had initially hoped the project, to fuel an expansion of Exxon Mobil’s PNG LNG plant, would be approved in 2018, but talks with the government took longer than expected after an earthquake hit the country. \r\n",
      "The project intends to develop the Elk and Antelope gas fields to feed two new processing units, or trains, to be built at the PNG LNG plant run by Exxon Mobil. \r\n",
      "The Total-led Papua LNG project is also looking to sign-off on the development of a third new train to be supplied from its existing PNG LNG fields and the new P’nyang field. \r\n",
      "All together, the developments are expected to double the PNG LNG plant’s output to around 16 million tonnes a year, with analysts estimating the overall expansion will cost around $13 billion. \r\n",

      "Content:  215 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ohio’s Sherrod Brown faces a vexing question: In a 2020 Democratic presidential race already crowded with some of the party’s biggest progressive stars, is there room for his perpetually rumpled brand of blue-collar populism? \r\n",
      "Brown, one of the U.S. Senate’s staunchest liberals, kicks off a tour of early primary states on Wednesday to try to find out. \r\n",
      "His allies say his support for liberal social causes and his proven appeal to blue-collar workers make him a uniting force in a party debating whether to focus on winning back working class voters who favored Republican Donald Trump in 2016 or rally the suburban, women and minority voters who fueled the party’s gains in last November’s congressional elections. \r\n",
      "But he also is a 66-year-old white male in a party considering a new generation of leadership and driven by the diversity that propelled record numbers of women, and many minority candidates, into the U.S. House of Representatives. \r\n",
      "David Betras, the Democratic chairman of Ohio’s heavily blue-collar Mahoning County, said Brown “is genuinely wrestling” with whether to launch a White House bid. \r\n",
      "“He’s the perfect antidote for Donald Trump,” said Betras, who had lunch with Brown recently. “Sherrod Brown was running on economic populism before Donald Trump knew what it meant.” \r\n",
      "In a Democratic race featuring progressive leaders with far bigger national profiles such as Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and possibly Bernie Sanders, Brown remains relatively unknown and untested outside Ohio despite more than two decades as one of the most liberal voices in Congress. \r\n",
      "He relishes his disheveled image, letting people know he drives a Jeep Cherokee made in Toledo, Ohio, and wears suits made within 10 miles of his Cleveland home. \r\n",
      "He caught the attention of national Democrats in November, when he easily won a third U.S. Senate term even though Republicans swept every other statewide contest. Trump won the state by 8 percentage points in 2016. \r\n",
      "Brown said in his victory speech that the result proved “progressives can win - and win decisively - in the heartland” and provided a blueprint for Democrats in 2020. \r\n",
      "“He’s the right messenger with the right message, and I don’t see anybody else out there offering that approach,” said Democratic Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, who started a “Draft Sherrod Brown” group to urge him to run. \r\n",
      "MAKING HIS CASE \r\n",
      "Brown says he is still weeks away from a decision about running. \r\n",
      "He will begin his “Dignity of Work” tour of states with early nominating contests outside his hometown of Cleveland before heading to the crucial kickoff state of Iowa. Trips to New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada will follow. \r\n",
      "“We’re going to listen to people and talk to people and figure out what we’ll do,” Brown told CNN over the weekend. Asked what might keep him from running, he said: “It’s an earthquake to a family.” \r\n",
      "Labor and progressive leaders said there was plenty of time and interest for Brown to make his case for the White House against better-known competitors. Most groups do not plan endorsements until later in the year. \r\n",
      "Brown has demonstrated a strong ability to raise campaign cash, bringing in more than $28 million for his Senate re-election last year. That included more than 162,000 individual donors with an average individual contribution of approximately $43, his campaign said. \r\n",
      "While a proponent of the goal of universal healthcare, he has refused to back a “Medicare for all” bill supported by many other Democrats considering a White House bid. He prefers a buy-in for Medicare, a healthcare program for seniors that normally kicks in at age 65, for those 55 and older, calling it a more realistic step. \r\n",
      "A longtime opponent of free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Brown has supported Trump’s trade views and blocked a bipartisan Senate effort to limit the president’s power to impose tariffs. Brown believes national policies have not always represented the best interests of auto and other manufacturing workers in his state. \r\n",
      "Ohio Republicans questioned Brown’s growing national reputation for electability in the industrial Midwest, noting he beat a weak Republican challenger in U.S. Representative Jim Renacci. \r\n",
      "“He’s a good communicator, but what is he communicating?” asked Jon Stainbrook, a former Republican chairman in Lucas County, a big automaking center. “He comes across as the friend of the working man, but he’s just another Democratic liberal.” \r\n",
      "But Leo Connelly, 71, a disabled Vietnam veteran and Trump supporter from Youngstown, Ohio, who voted for Brown last year, said he was convinced of Brown’s sincerity. \r\n",
      "“I would go in a foxhole with him any day, I really believe he is there for us,” Connelly said. \r\n",

      "WASHINGTON The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is failing to recognize the full range of dangers posed by a potential dirty bomb attack and needs to take more action to secure high-risk radioactive material, according to a government watchdog report released Thursday.\r\n",
      "In assessing the possible effect of a radioactive dirty bomb detonated in an American city, the U.S. nuclear regulator has only focused on the possible health effects caused by the spread of radiation, the Government Accountability Office report said. But the NRC has not taken into account the potential consequences of a panic-driven evacuation and costly decontamination effort, according to the report.\r\n",
      "\"NRC's regulatory approach in many ways is based on the idea that a dirty bomb would not be a high consequence event,\" said David Trimble, director of the National Resources and Environment office at the GAO.\r\n",
      "\"Their view of what the risk is is very circumscribed, it's very narrow.\"\r\n",
      "A dirty bomb uses a conventional explosive combined with radioactive material to spread radiation over a wider area, and some terrorist groups have sought to construct such a device over the years.\r\n",
      "Rather than deaths or harm caused by radiation, the most significant impact of a radioactive dirty bomb would be its disruptive effect, by spreading panic, prompting evacuations, requiring clean-up work and undermining economic activity, said the report, citing experts convened by the National Academy of Sciences as well as other studies.\r\n",
      "A chaotic evacuation could cause more deaths than any radiation released in an attack, and the results of the disruption and contamination could cause billions of dollars in damage, the report said.\r\n",

      "\"Few deaths would occur due to the radioactive nature of the event,\" the report said. \"However, significant social and economic impacts could result from public panic, decontamination costs, and the denial of access to infrastructure and property for extended periods of time.\"\r\n",
      "The report cited the 2011 meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant after an earthquake and subsequent tsunami, saying more people died from the evacuation process than from radiation releases or the effects of the natural disasters.\r\n",
      "The NRC's staff operates under guidelines that require it to only evaluate the risk of a dirty bomb based on immediate deaths and other health effects of the radiation released.\r\n",

      "The GAO also urged the nuclear agency to take additional measures to safeguard smaller quantities of high-risk radioactive material, arguing that even smaller amounts could still have major consequences in a dirty bomb incident.\r\n",
      "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission disagreed with most of the report's findings, saying the GAO's view was based on unlikely scenarios and selected opinions from experts.\r\n",

      "The GAO report was based in part on a meeting of 18 experts across a range of fields arranged with the NRC and the National Academies of Sciences. But in its letter, the NRC said the GAO had relied on \"selected aspects of the panel discussion to form the primary basis for its recommendations\" and referred to \"statements of one or two panel members to draw overarching conclusions.\"\r\n",
      "The nuclear regulator disagreed with the report's reference to the Fukushima example on evacuations, arguing it was no equivalent to a possible dirty bomb scenario. In Fukushima, the nuclear power plant meltdown was accompanied by an earthquake and tsunami, which complicated evacuation efforts, the NRC said.\r\n",
      "The NRC also rejected a GAO recommendation to bolster security measures for certain quantities of a radioactive material, americium-241, stored in close proximity, saying it had already taken sufficient steps.\r\n",
      "The NRC said it seeks \"to balance the need for the protection of radioactive materials with their availability for beneficial uses in the medical, academic, and industrial environments.\"\r\n",
      "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has come under frequent criticism over the decades from lawmakers, environmental and watchdog groups that it is overly deferential to the nuclear industry. The NRC's supporters have rejected the criticism as an attempt to tarnish nuclear power as a viable energy source.\r\n",
      "Over the past decade, the GAO has previously taken the NRC to task for how it oversees security measures for radioactive material. The NRC accepted the findings in those audits and took action to tighten rules for organizations licensed to use radioactive materials for commercial, medical or research purposes.\r\n",

      "Title:  224 Updating software, shaping history: New imperial era name looms large in Japan\n",
      "Content:  224 TOKYO (Reuters) - In Japan, every emperor’s era has its own name - appearing in places such as coins, official paperwork and newspapers - and with abdication coming at the end of April, speculation is swirling about what the new “gengo” will be. \r\n",
      "Although the Western calendar has become more widespread in Japan, many people here count years in terms of gengo or use the two systems interchangeably. Emperor Akihito’s era, which began in 1989, is Heisei, making 2019 Heisei 31. \r\n",
      "The new era name is one of biggest changes practically and psychologically for Japan at the start of Crown Prince Naruhito’s reign on May 1. On April 30, Akihito will abdicate, ending an era in the minds of many Japanese. \r\n",
      "The new name is so secret that senior government officials involved in the decision must surrender their cell phones and stay sequestered until it is broadcast, media reports say. \r\n",
      "City offices and government agencies, which mostly use gengo in their computer systems and paperwork, have been preparing for months to avoid glitches. \r\n",
      "To make the transition easier, authorities will announce the new gengo two Chinese characters the cabinet chooses from a short list proposed by scholars a month early, on April 1. \r\n",
      "“We’ve been working on this change for about a year,” said Tsukasa Shizume, an official in the Tokyo suburb of Mitaka, where the era name will be changed on 55 kinds of paperwork in 20 administrative sections. The month-long lead time should be sufficient, he said. \r\n",
      "Fujitsu and NEC Corp. have been helping customers ensure the switch doesn’t crash their systems. Programs have been designed to make it easy to change the gengo, said Shunichi Ueda, an NEC official. \r\n",
      "“If people want to test their computer systems, they can use a trial gengo and see if it works,” he said. \r\n",
      "Most major companies use the Western calendar in their computer systems, so it won’t affect them as much, although smaller companies might run into some problems, he said. \r\n",
      "In Tokyo’s Minato ward, officials will cross out Heisei on thousands of documents and stamp the new gengo above it. \r\n",
      "NATIONAL MOOD \r\n",
      "The era name is more than just a way of counting years for many Japanese. \r\n",
      "It’s a word that captures the national mood of a period, similar to the way “the ‘60s” evokes particular feelings or images, or how historians refer to Britain’s “Victorian” or “Edwardian” eras, tying the politics and culture of a period to a monarch. \r\n",
      "“It’s a way of dividing history,” said Jun Iijima, a 31-year-old lawyer who was born the last year of Showa, the era of Akihito’s father, Emperor Hirohito. “If you were just counting years, the Western system might be sufficient. But gengo gives a certain meaning to a historical period.” \r\n",
      "The 64-year Showa era, which lasted until 1989, has generally come to be identified with Japan’s recovery and rising global prominence in the decades after World War Two. \r\n",
      "The imperial era name is also a form of “soft nationalism,” said Ken Ruoff, director of the Center for Japanese Studies at Portland State University. \r\n",
      "“It’s one of these constant low-level reminders that Japan counts years differently and Japan has a monarchy,” he said. \r\n",
      "The gengo characters are carefully chosen with an aspirational meaning. Heisei, which means “achieving peace,” began on Jan. 8, 1989, amid high hopes that Japan would play a greater role in global affairs after decades of robust economic growth. \r\n",
      "Soon afterward, Japan’s economic bubble popped, ushering in a long period of stagnation and deflation. The rise of China and South Korea diminished Japan’s international prominence, and a series of disasters - including the 1995 Kobe earthquake and 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crises - has marred Heisei’s image. \r\n",
      "FADING USE \r\n",
      "In daily life, usage of the gengo system is slowly declining as Japan integrates into the global economy. \r\n",
      "A recent Mainichi newspaper survey showed that 34 percent of people said they used mostly gengo, 34 percent said they used both about the same, and 25 percent mainly the Western calendar. In 1975, 82 percent said mostly gengo. Both calendars use Western months. \r\n",
      "Japanese drivers licenses have started to print both dates, instead of just gengo. \r\n",
      "Iijima, the lawyer, says legal paperwork uses the era name because that’s what the court system uses. But in daily life he uses both. For global events, he thinks in terms of the Western calendar - like the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks - and uses both dating systems for domestic events. \r\n",
      "He is indifferent about what characters will be chosen for the next gengo. \r\n",
      "But remembering that his grandparents suffered during World War Two, he hopes that it will be an era without war, that Japan will keep up economically with China and India and that it will grow into a “mature,” more tolerant place. \r\n",
      "“I hope Japan can become a society where minorities can live more easily,” he said. \r\n",

      "Content:  225 TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s economy expanded in the fourth quarter as business and consumer spending recovered from natural disasters, however global trade protectionism remained a concern for the country. \r\n",
      "The 1.4 percent annualized expansion in October-December matched the median estimate in a Reuters poll. It followed a revised 2.6 percent annualized contraction in July-September as floods and an earthquake temporarily halted production. \r\n",
      "The data also showed real exports rose 0.9 percent in October-December from the previous quarter, which was the fastest gain in a year. \r\n",
      "Despite the increase in shipments, some economists remain concerned that exports will weaken this year if the United States and China do not resolve their trade dispute. \r\n",
      "Cabinet Office data showed GDP rose 0.3 percent versus the previous quarter, slightly less than the median estimate for 0.4 percent growth. That followed a downwardly revised 0.7 percent contraction in July-September. \r\n",
      "In September a large earthquake triggered a blackout in the northern island of Hokkaido, which followed severe typhoons that damaged airports and transport infrastructure in western Japan. \r\n",
      "Businesses were quick to resume normal operations after these disasters. \r\n",
      "Capital expenditure was the biggest driver of growth in October-December, rising 2.4 percent. That compares with an upwardly revised 2.7 percent contraction in the previous quarter. The median estimate was for capital expenditure to rise 1.8 percent. \r\n",
      "Private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of GDP, was the second-biggest driver of growth. Consumption rose 0.6 percent in October-December, which was less than the median estimate for a 0.8 percent increase and followed a 0.2 decline in the previous quarter. \r\n",
      "External demand - or exports minus imports - shaved 0.3 percentage point off gross domestic product, less than the median estimate of minus 0.4 percent. A breakdown of the data showed a 2.7 percent jump in imports more than offset the increase in exports. \r\n",
      "Despite the rise in exports, some economists remain cautious about the outlook for overseas demand. \r\n",
      "A trade war between the United States and China, the world’s two largest economies, is a major risk for Japan’s exports of car parts, electronics, and heavy machinery to China, which are used to make finished goods destined for the United States and other markets. \r\n",
      "Another risk is the Japanese government’s plan to raise the nationwide sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in October. \r\n",
      "The government needs the extra tax revenue to pay for rising welfare costs, but some policymakers and economists worry the tax hike could hit consumer spending and weaken sentiment. \r\n",

      "LOS ANGELES A violent earthquake struck Southern California before dawn today, turning freeways into rubble, collapsing buildings with a savage power and igniting fires that sent swirls of smoke across the hazy, battered city. At least 24 people died.\r\n",
      "The quake, centered in the San Fernando Valley, buckled overpasses on three freeways, trapping motorists in tons of concrete rubble. It severed Interstate 5, California's main north-south highway, and Interstate 10, the nation's busiest freeway.\r\n",
      "\"This place was moving like a jackhammer was going at it,\" said Richard Goodis of Sherman Oaks, an affluent San Fernando Valley suburb. \"Our bedroom wall tore away. I was looking at the ceiling one moment, then I was looking at the sky. I thought we were dead.\"\r\n",
      "The quake derailed a freight train carrying hazardous material and briefly closed several airports, including Los Angeles International. Power and telephone service were lost throughout Southern California.\r\n",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and California Gov. Pete Wilson declared states of emergency, and President Clinton said he expected to issue a federal disaster declaration later in the day.\r\n",
      "Wilson called out the National Guard. In addition, fire rescue teams responded from as far away as San Francisco.\r\n",
      "The quake struck at 4:31 a.m., and measured a preliminary 6.6 on the Richter scale, said Kate Hutton, a seismologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Although not as strong as some quakes in recent years, it was unusually destructive because of its location in a populous area.\r\n",
      "A swarm of aftershocks, some as strong as 5 on the Richter scale, jostled the region throughout the morning, and seismologists said they could continue for several days.\r\n",
      "The dead, according to hospital and police reports, were:\r\n",
      " Fourteen people crushed to death in an apartment building in Northridge.\r\n",
      " Five people who died of quake-related heart attacks, three at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and two at Holy Cross Medical Center in Sylmar.\r\n",

      "The building, half a block from California State University, Northridge, housed mostly college students. An identical building next to it buckled, but didn't collapse. Hundreds of people watched firefighters search the rubble.\r\n",
      "The entire building \"shifted north about six feet,\" said fire Battalion Chief Bob De Feo. A third-floor resident, Eric Pearson, told Cable News Network that he felt a huge jolt that lifted the building off its foundation, moved it over and slammed it down.\r\n",
      "In a dramatic and dangerous rescue nearby, searchers spent hours digging through the wreckage of a parking garage at the Northridge Fashion Center before pulling out a 35-year-old street sweeper alive. The quake had turned the multi-story garage into a 20-foot-high pancake of concrete, and transformed the mall's Bullocks department store into a gnarled pile of concrete and steel.\r\n",
      "Richard Andrews, California's emergency services director, said the early hour and the Martin Luther King holiday reduced the number of people exposed to injury in the quake.\r\n",
      "That was easy to forget in the chaos at the Sylmar hospital, which was swamped by more than 250 new patients. The hospital's disaster coordinator, Mark Wallerstein, told those without serious injury to go elsewhere.\r\n",
      "\"We have no power, no laboratory, no X-rays, no pharmacy and almost no food,\" Wallerstein told them. He later said the hospital was operating on emergency power.\r\n",
      "In Los Angeles, Cedars Sinai was receiving \"a tidal wave of walking wounded,\" hospital spokesman Ron Wise said.\r\n",

      "Content:  239 Feb. 11, 2019, 6:56 PM GMT\r\n",
      "Immigrants from Honduras and Nepal have filed a lawsuit alleging the Trump administration unfairly ended a program that lets them live and work in the United States.\r\n",
      "The lawsuit filed late Sunday in federal court in San Francisco alleges that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's decision to end so-called temporary protected status for the countries was motivated by racism.\r\n",
      "The suit which was filed on behalf of six immigrants and two of their American-born children also alleges that the department changed how it evaluated conditions in these countries when determining whether immigrants could return there.\r\n",
      "\"We bring evidence the Trump administration has repeatedly denigrated non-white non-European immigrants and reviewed TPS designations with a goal of removing such non-white non-European immigrants from the United States,\" said Minju Cho, a staff attorney at Asian Americans Advancing Justice in Los Angeles.\r\n",
      "The group is one of several representing the immigrant plaintiffs, who live California, Minnesota, Maryland, Virginia and Connecticut.\r\n",
      "A message seeking comment was left for the Department of Homeland Security.\r\n",
      "The lawsuit is the latest in a series of court filings challenging the Trump administration's decision to end the program for a cluster of countries whose citizens have lived and worked legally in the United States for years.\r\n",
      "Last year, a federal judge in San Francisco temporarily blocked the U.S. government from halting the program for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan. The suit filed on behalf of citizens of those countries, in addition to this one, cited Trump's vulgar language during a meeting last year to describe African countries.\r\n",
      "The U.S. government grants temporary protected status, also known as TPS, to citizens of countries ravaged by natural disasters or war so they can stay and work legally in the United States until the situation improves back home.\r\n",
      "The status is short-term but renewable and some immigrants have lived in the country for decades, raising American-born children, buying homes and building careers.\r\n",
      "Critics have said the program was meant to be temporary and shouldn't be extended for so long.\r\n",
      "The Trump administration announced last year that the program would be ending for Honduras and Nepal. Honduras was designated for the program after a devastating 1998 hurricane and about 86,000 immigrants from the country have the status, according to the lawsuit.\r\n",
      "About 15,000 immigrants from Nepal which was designated following an earthquake in 2015 are covered, the suit said.\r\n",
      "Together, these immigrants have more than 50,000 American-born children who would be affected by an end to the program, which lets those who are already in the United States stay in the country and obtain work permits, the suit said.\r\n",
      "One of them is the 9-year-old daughter of Honduran citizen Donaldo Posadas Caceres, who came to the United States shortly before the hurricane in 1998. After Honduras was designated for the program, he obtained the status, and now works as a bridge painter and owns his home in Baltimore, Maryland.\r\n",

      "As the world's largest democracy starts voting this week in a phased general election carried out over six weeks, this attitude is posing a problem for election officials seeking to combat the spread of fake news among a population that experts say has proven highly susceptible to believing it.\r\n",
      "Despite efforts by India's Election Commission to work with social media giants, urging them to tackle the spread of misinformation, at least one former top election official is warning that fake news could end up being the deciding factor in some constituencies with extremely tight races.\r\n",
      "The election is already taking place in a charged atmosphere as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party seeks a second term by pushing policies that some say have increased religious tensions and undermined multiculturalism.\r\n",

      "Tackling fake news is a huge challenge in India, a nation with 1.14 billion cellphone connections, the most Facebook users in the world at 300 million, and another 240 million users of the messaging service WhatsApp. In such an environment, fake news can spread faster than regulators can act.\r\n",
      "Watchdogs say in the run-up to the vote they've seen everything from manipulated pictures being picked up by mainstream news media, to misrepresented quotes sparking communal division, false news and hateful propaganda. And it looks like people are buying it.\r\n",

      "Efforts by social media giants to combat fake news in the country were intensified after executives were called in by the Election Commission earlier this year and told to curb the spread of manipulative political information and adhere to the country's laws on election campaigning.\r\n",
      "Social media companies followed that with a \"Voluntary Code of Ethics\" for the elections that they submitted to the government. It's essentially a best practices agreement that they will try to abide by the Election Commission's suggestions and rules, including prohibiting campaign advertisements for at least 48 hours before polling begins.\r\n",

      "\"The internet has grown up and is having to leave its parents' home and find a job,\" he said, suggesting that platforms should tune their search engine algorithms to weigh the credibility of sources more heavily than ads and viral content.\r\n",

      "Content:  241 Fissures appear along roads while massive holes open up in the countryside, their gaping maws a visible sign from the air of something Iranian authorities now openly acknowledge: the area around Tehran is literally sinking.\r\n",
      "Stressed by a 30-year drought and hollowed by excessive water pumping, the parched landscape around Iran's capital has begun to sink dramatically. Seen by satellite and on foot around the city, officials warn that what they call land subsidence poses a grave danger to a country where protests over water scarcity already have seen violence.\r\n",
      "\"Land subsidence is a destructive phenomenon,\" said Siavash Arabi, a measurement expert at Iran's cartography department. \"Its impact may not be immediately felt like an earthquake, but as you can see, it can gradually cause destructive changes over time.\"\r\n",
      "He said he can identify \"destruction of farmland, the cracks of the earth's surface, damage to civilian areas in cities, wastewater lines, cracks in roads and damages to water and natural gas pipes.\"\r\n",
      "Tehran, which sits 1,200 meters (3,900 feet) above sea level against the Alborz Mountains on a plateau, has rapidly grown over the last 100 years to a sprawling city of 13 million people in its metropolitan area.\r\n",
      "All those people have put incredible pressure on water resources on a semi-arid plateau in a country that saw only 171 millimeters (6.7 inches) of rain last year. Over-reliance on ground aquifers has seen increasingly salty water pumped from below ground.\r\n",
      "\"Surface soil contains water and air. When you pump water from under the ground surface, you cause some empty space to be formed in the soil,\" Arabi told The Associated Press. \"Gradually, the pressure from above causes the soil particles to stick together and this leads to sinking of the ground and formation of cracks.\"\r\n",
      "Rain and snow to recharge the underground aquifers have been in short supply. Over the past decade, Iran has seen the most prolonged and severe drought in more than 30 years, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. An estimated 97 percent of the country has faced some level of drought, Iran's Meteorological Organization says.\r\n",
      "That has caused the sinkholes and fissures now seen around Tehran.\r\n",
      "Iranian authorities say they have measured up to 22 centimeters (8.6 inches) of annual subsidence near the capital, while the normal range would be only as high as 3 centimeters (1.1 inches) per year.\r\n",
      "Even higher numbers have been measured in other parts of the country. Some sinkholes formed in western Iran are as deep as 60 meters (196 feet).\r\n",
      "Those figures are close to those found in a study by scientists at the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam previously discussed by the journal Nature and accepted by the journal Remote Sensing of Environment. Using satellite images between 2003 and 2017, the scientists estimate the western Tehran plain is sinking by 25 centimeters (9.8 inches) a year.\r\n",
      "Either way, the numbers are alarming to experts.\r\n",
      "\"In European countries, even 4 millimeters (0.15 inches) of yearly subsidence is considered a crisis,\" Iranian environmental activist Mohammad Darvish said.\r\n",
      "The sinking can be seen in Tehran's southern Yaftabad neighborhood, which sits close to farmland and water wells on the edge of the city. Cracks run down walls and below windows, and waterpipes have ruptured. Residents fear poorly built buildings may collapse.\r\n",
      "The sinking also threatens vital infrastructure, like Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport. German scientists estimate that land under the airport is sinking by 5 centimeters (1.9 inches) a year.\r\n",
      "Tehran's oil refinery, a key highway, automobile manufacturing plants and railroads also all sit on sinking ground, said Ali Beitollahi, a Ministry of Roads and Transportation official. Some 2 million people live in the area, he said.\r\n",
      "Masoud Shafiee, head of Iran's cartography department, also acknowledged the danger.\r\n",
      "\"Rates (for subsidence) are very high and in many instances it's happening in densely populated areas,\" Shafiee told the AP. \"It's happening near sensitive infrastructures like airports, which we consider a top priority.\"\r\n",
      "Geopolitics play a role in Iran's water crisis. Since the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has sought to become self-sufficient across industries to thwart international sanctions. That has included agriculture and food production.\r\n",
      "The problem, however, comes in inefficient water use on farms, which represents over 90 percent of the country's water usage, experts say.\r\n",
      "Already, the drought and water crisis has fed into the sporadic unrest Iran has faced over the last year.

      "Content:  252 The whale sighting happened right away, minutes into Day 1. Jon, Dave and I had just been dropped off on a remote Alaskan shoreline, an hour and a half by boat from the closest speck of a town. Jon was working as a sea-kayaking guide that summer in Glacier Bay National Park, and he had invited us up for a seven-day excursion during his week off. As the boat that delivered us vanished, the drone of its engine dampening into a murmur and then finally trailing off, it became unthinkably quiet on the beach, and the largeness and strangeness of our surroundings were suddenly apparent. It was a familiar phenomenon for Jon from the start of all his trips: a moment that people instinctually paused to soak in. To me, it felt like those scenes of astronauts who, having finally rattled free of the earth’s atmosphere, slip into the stillness of space. Except we weren’t in space. We were on earth — finally, really on earth.\r\n",
      "We were only starting to move around again, packing our gear into the kayaks, when we heard the first huff of a blowhole, not far offshore.\r\n",
      "Jon was ecstatic. It seemed to him as if the animal were putting on a show, swimming playfully in the kelp, diving, resurfacing, then plowing its open mouth across the surface to feed. He took it as a good omen. Though I had no idea at the time, he was anxious that Dave and I might feel intimidated about making the trip; such a big payoff, so quickly, would get us excited and defuse any apprehensions.\r\n",
      "For Dave, the whale-sighting had exactly the opposite effect. Once, when he was a kid, his dad took him scuba diving with dolphins. They were friendly, awe-inspiring creatures, purportedly, but they terrified Dave instead. He could still conjure the feeling of hanging defenselessly in that water while the animals deftly swirled around him, less like solid objects than flashes of reflected light, while he could move only in comparative slow-motion. Ever since, he had harbored a fear of large sea creatures — a niche phobia, particularly for a young man who lived in the Bronx, but a genuine one still. And so, even as Dave understood that a chance to see whales up close like this was a major draw of a kayaking trip in Alaska, and though he feigned being thrilled, some second thoughts were kicking in: We were going out there, he realized.\r\n",
      "The whale left me exhilarated and gleeful, like Jon; but deeper down, I also remember feeling shaken, like Dave. Nothing about the animal registered to me as playful or welcoming. It just appeared in the distance, then transited quickly past us, from left to right. My uneasiness had something to do with the whale’s great size and indifference — its obliviousness — as it passed. Watching it made me feel profoundly out of place and register how large that wilderness was, relative to me.\r\n",
      "At the time, I was working at a literary magazine in New York City called The Hudson Review, picking poems out of the slush pile and mailing them to an outside panel of editorial advisers. I was trying hard in my letters to impress one of them: Hayden Carruth, a gruff and irreverent 81-year-old poet who lived far upstate. I loved Carruth’s work but was more enamored with his persona: his yeoman life in the woods, his intolerance for phoniness and, most of all, the precision with which he articulated common suffering, including one strain of his own suffering that I related to, particularly in those years, but wouldn’t have had the courage, or clarity, to examine.\r\n",
      "“I had always been aware,” Carruth once wrote of his youth, “that the Universe is sad; everything in it, animate or inanimate, the wild creatures, the stones, the stars, was enveloped in the great sadness, pervaded by it. ... Never then or now have I been able to look at a cloudless sky at night and see beauty there. A kind of grandeur, yes — but not beauty. The profusion and variety of celestial lights have always frightened me. Why are they there? Why these instead of others? Why these instead of nothing?”\r\n",
      "That was how I felt, watching the whale from the beach: afraid that everything was accidents. Then again, maybe it’s just hard to picture the start of the trip in retrospect without amplifying some feeling of foreboding. Something else Carruth wrote that has always stuck with me: “The wilderness begins at the edge of my body, at the edge of my consciousness, and extends to the edge of the universe, and it is filled with menace.”\r\n",
      "[Read about Aleksander Doba, the 71-year-old who kayaked across the Atlantic 3 times.]\r\n",
      "It was mid-August 2002, and we were 23, 24 and 25. We had graduated from college together two years earlier. Dave, whom I also grew up with, shot out of undergrad knowing he wanted to be a doctor and had just finished his first year of medical school. Any similar momentum I had after graduation was instantly sapped. Three nights after I returned to my parents’ house from school, I found myself driving my father to the emergency room. Three weeks after that, he died. My grief was disorienting and total; at a moment in life when everything is supposed to feel possible, making any single decision became impossible. I gave into that sadness for the better part of a year, resettling at home in New Jersey with my widowed mother and sliding back to the summer job I worked during school, glumly breaking down beef at a butcher shop two towns over.\r\n",
      "I coped with my fatherlessness and confusion in ways I’m not proud of and still don’t understand. I read a lot of books about Ronald Reagan, for example, even the collection of his love letters to Nancy. I also lashed out at Dave, who was living at home that summer, too, studying for the MCAT. He withdrew awkwardly after the funeral, and I suppose I was happy to hold that against him. It triggered some longstanding jealousy. A part of me always resented how he seemed unfairly exempt from the self-doubt and heaviness that I was prone to.\r\n",
      "Jon, meanwhile, was teaching at a rustic little boarding school in Switzerland, where his mother was from. The summer after graduation, before starting the job, he set out for Alaska with a friend, sleeping in the bed of their old pickup. In the minuscule town of Gustavus, the gateway to Glacier Bay, he picked up seasonal work in the warehouse of a kayak-tour company. Jon had little actual experience of sea kayaking but had always felt drawn to the ocean in the abstract. In college, he and another friend plotted out a paddling expedition near Glacier Bay, across the border in Canada and applied for a grant from our school to fund it. The grant was set up in memory of an alumnus who died in an avalanche while mountaineering. It was meant to encourage the “responsible and conscientious pursuit of wilderness expeditions.” Safety was key. But the committee rejected Jon and his partner’s application. They seemed insufficiently prepared.\r\n",
      "That wasn’t surprising. Jon grew up doing a lot of backcountry camping and was a competent outdoorsman, but putting together a grant application required a kind of administrative fastidiousness he didn’t always possess. He was bright but scatterbrained, forever picking up things and putting them down, both figuratively (music projects, conversations) but also literally. I can still picture him hustling around the house we shared in college, hunting for his keys or his soldering iron, having gotten in over his head rewiring some device. He was an artist; one piece I remember consisted of a half-peeled banana, implanted with circuitry and suspended in a jar of formaldehyde. Once, he grew grass in our upstairs bathroom — a living bathmat, he said — until the turf became muddy and flooded the downstairs.\r\n",
      "This was Jon’s third summer in Alaska, and he’d worked his way up to leading expeditions, taking out vacationers for days at a time. Our trip, however, would venture beyond the typical circuit, into a remote corner of the park that he’d never been to. Jon had no serious concerns about our safety, but he felt he bore responsibility for our emotional well-being. To enjoy ourselves, we would need to feel comfortable, not just in the wilderness but also with him as a leader.\r\n",
      "He suspected we wouldn’t trust him entirely. We didn’t. We knew him before he became a professional guide, and our perception of his expertise lagged behind the reality. “With Jon,” Dave told me, “it was always unclear to what extent he’d thought everything through.” Dave remembered landing in Gustavus the night before we got underway and casually asking Jon a lot of questions: Where are we going, exactly? Do we have everything we need? Jon seemed to have solid answers for all of them. As we headed back to his place for a good night’s sleep, he told us to wait in the yard. He was living alone for the summer in a house that an acquaintance was building in the woods. The structure was framed-up but largely wall-less, and Jon, to be safe, needed to check that no moose had wandered in.\r\n",
      "After a spectacular first day of paddling, we came ashore on a rocky tidal flat about two miles from where we were dropped. Jon gave us his detailed tutorial about bear safety while we set up our campsite. He taught us, for example, to holler “Hey, bear!” if we heard any rustling but also preventively, ahead of us, when we walked through the woods. The last thing you wanted was to come across a brown bear unannounced.\r\n",
      "“Hey, bear!” Jon kept hollering, by way of demonstration. He said it goofily, like a children’s TV host greeting some down-on-his-luck ursine neighbor at the doorway to their clubhouse. This was intentional. Jon had noticed that the people on his trips often resisted bellowing “Hey, bear!” into the wilderness. It was essential for their safety, but it felt silly or vulnerable somehow, like singing in public. So he learned to turn it into a shtick, spinning it into a stream-of-consciousness narration: Hey, bear, I’m coming into the trees now. Hope you’re having a fantastic evening, Mr. Bear! It loosened everyone up. They were performing for their friends now; the whole group was in on the joke.\r\n",
      "I had never seen a wild bear, though I have backpacked in bear country a handful of times. I felt comfortable with the animals in the abstract. But here, the bears weren’t abstract; they breached the material plane. There were bear trails everywhere, leading from the tree line to the water, and disquietingly close, I felt, to where we were pitching our tent. We found heaps of their scat. We saw trees where the animals had slashed off the bark to eat the inner layer, tufts of fur from their paws still plastered in the sap.\r\n",
      "I pretended I was having fun. But that evening I grew increasingly petrified, almost delirious. My eyes tightened, scanning for bears. The sound of the wind became bears, and so did the mossy sticks cracking under our feet. I gave myself a migraine, then phased in and out of sleep.\r\n",
      "At sunrise, I woke feeling foolish. While Jon cooked pancakes, I reasoned with myself, privately, in a notebook I brought on the trip. I tried to conceive of the situation as a geometry problem. Yes, some number of bears roved this landscape, I wrote: relatively tiny, independent blips, going about their business randomly, just like us. In all that empty space and confusion, a lethal collision of their moving blips and our moving blips would be an improbable coincidence. I’d been distorting those odds, mistaking myself for “the absolute focus of all bears’ attention,” I wrote. It was embarrassing, really. “To be afraid of bears,” I concluded, “is to be narcissistic.”\r\n",
      "I was reminding myself that freakishly horrible things are, by definition, unlikely to happen. Even now, my reasoning feels sound.\r\n",
      "[Read about the search for a missing hiker in Joshua Tree’s wild interior.]\r\n",
      "Day 2 was a slog. We paddled through a spitting drizzle in an endless straight line, along the high granite walls of the coast. We talked less and less, just pushed through the emerald chop. Then eventually we gave up, hauling in our boats and making camp in a wide, crescent-shaped cove, short of the site that Jon originally picked out on his map.\r\n",
      "We had entered Dundas Bay, a rarely visited pocket of the national park that, I’ve since learned, has a storied history as a hide-out for solitary misanthropes. In the 1930s, one prospector built a cabin not far from our campsite and brandished a gun at the Alaska Natives who passed through.\r\n",
      "We intuited that the scenery was beautiful, but we could see very little of it through the fog. Our guidebook explained that “the east side of the bay” — where we were — “can get extremely rough during foul weather, since large waves roll in ... and batter this shoreline.” That was happening now: The weather that plinked at us all afternoon was roiling into a storm. Soon, the big rain started. We rushed through dinner, then loafed in our tent until, eventually, the loafing turned to sleep.\r\n",
      "A local newspaper would later describe the storm as “short but intense.” In Gustavus, a creek swelled to about a foot higher than its previous record. Gale winds, with gusts up to 59 miles per hour, turned back two cruise ships in Skagway, about 85 miles north. Around 2 a.m., we woke to discover the wind had shorn the rain fly off our tent. Jon’s sleeping bag and mine were soaked, while Dave was snug and dry between us. We heard torrents of water lashing down and the waves crashing in the cove.\r\n",
      "We got up three or four hours later. The rain and wind no longer felt ferocious but were still too gnarly to paddle through; there was no question, Jon said, that we were staying put. We cooked breakfast and took turns playing chess in the tent. By late morning, the storm seemed to have passed. We were antsy. We figured we would take a look around.\r\n",
      "The terrain was crammed with thickets of alder and spruce, underlain by ferns and a furor of prickly things. Jon pointed out devil’s club: three or four feet tall and leafy, armored up and down with spines. The plant pierced fleece and hurt like fire.\r\n",
      "There were no trails. We’d been trudging for some time when we reached a fast-moving stream, maybe 10 feet wide. Jon was surprised; it wasn’t on his map, most likely just a drainage bloated by the storm. We followed it downstream, looking for a way across, and eventually found it bridged by a hefty tree trunk. It seemed like an easy crossing. Jon stepped up and led the way, and Dave and I waited in a single-file line on the stream bank behind him. The creek was loud, like a factory with all its gears and rollers churning. Looking down, Jon realized there was more water than he’d thought.\r\n",
      "That’s when I heard the snap in the woods behind me. After all my paranoia, I instantly understood that the many bears I’d thought I heard before were absolutely not bears — were nothing — because this sound was so unmistakable and crisp, so explicitly something. I turned and hollered, “Hey, bear!” then waited a beat. Maybe I said “Hey, bear!” again; I’m not sure. But I must have scanned those trees long enough to feel satisfied and safe, because I know I was turning my head, to go back to my friends, when I saw the dark shape rushing forward in my peripheral vision.\r\n",
      "What I heard must have been roots popping. If a tree is large enough, you can apparently hear them cracking underground like gunfire.\r\n",
      "The thud was seismic. The trunk crashed down right next to me. Mapping out bits of evidence later, we concluded that the tree must have been about 80 feet tall and perhaps two feet in diameter. It was some kind of conifer — a spruce or cedar. I screamed, involuntarily, “Look out!” then watched Dave, a few steps directly in front of me, dive sideways and hit the ground. When I got to him, he was crouching, stunned but O.K. He looked up and said, “Go get Jon.”\r\n",
      "It hadn’t clicked back in for me: There were three of us. The sight of Dave going down had canceled out everything else. I scrambled out over the creek, running across the tree that had just fallen, shouting Jon’s name, then spotted him in the water, tangled in a snarl of sheared-off branches near the bank behind me — a cage, which kept him from hurtling downstream.\r\n",
      "He did not know he’d been hit by a falling tree. It had narrowly missed his head, struck his left shoulder, shearing it from his collarbone and breaking many of his ribs. Later, a doctor would explain that the downward force had been so powerful that it had probably squashed Jon’s entire upper body, and all the organs inside, down toward his waist, momentarily compressing him like a bellows; for a split second, his shoulders headed in the direction of his bellybutton, before his torso sprang up again.\r\n",
      "Jon had heard nothing, seen nothing. He was turning around to help Dave onto the log — again, feeling responsible for our safety — and the next thing he knew, he was in the water. He tried to reach out his left arm but could not make it move. He could not move his legs. He felt a bolt of pain down his spine.\r\n",
      "Jon later described flashing through an idiosyncratic sequence of thoughts, all in a few milliseconds, as if watching a deck of cards fanning across a table. One was an image of himself in a wheelchair, sitting behind a mixing console in a fancy recording studio. “I guess I can become a recording engineer in a wheelchair,” he remembered thinking. He had never worked in a recording studio and, though he played music, he had no particular plans to. Still, this vision apparently felt like an acceptable future and freed him to resurface in the present. That was when he registered me, screaming his name.\r\n",
      "Jon told himself he shouldn’t move. He knew from his many wilderness first-responder trainings that moving a person with spinal injuries risks paralysis. Then again, he also knew that most of his body was submerged in cold water, and he recognized that he risked dying of hypothermia if he didn’t move. “If I’m already paralyzed,” he concluded, “I may as well move.”\r\n",
      "He somehow hoisted himself out of the stream before Dave or I got to him, using his right arm and his chin and biting into something loamy with his teeth, for additional leverage. He reassessed the situation: better. Also: worse. He now realized that we were at least a mile inland from our camp.\r\n",
      "Suddenly, his body was walking; his legs just started working. Dave and I put him between us, supporting his frame. He was moving faster than we expected, but uncoordinatedly. Then he crumpled between us. We tried again; Jon was dead weight. Dave noticed that his breathing was shallow and his voice was low — signs, Dave knew from med school, of a collapsed lung. He began battering Jon with a pep talk, telling him, firmly, that he had to get up, that we had to get out of here. Jon didn’t need that explained to him; he was cogent and still trying to plot our next steps in his mind. He looked down to see why this log he was resting on was so lumpy and realized that he was, in fact, sitting on his left arm. The arm was slack, obviously broken; his sleeve, pierced up and down with devil’s club. Jon had zero feeling in it. He found it amusing, this sensation of complete estrangement from one of his limbs.\r\n",
      "Jon had been stressing that it was important to stay together. But this was another theory of wilderness survival that appeared to be breaking down in practice. Someone would have to get on the radio back at our camp. By chance, while marooned in our tent during the rainstorm the night before, Jon showed us how to use the device, though he did it almost as a formality; the hand-held VHF unit was merely a line-of-sight radio, he told us, meaning its range was small, its signal too weak to pass through most obstacles. You were unlikely to reach anyone you couldn’t see, and we hadn’t seen anyone since a faraway fishing boat, early on Day 1.\r\n",
      "There was a moment of discussion, or maybe just an exchange of looks between me and Dave. I told Dave he should go. I didn’t trust myself to find my way back. I also knew that I lacked the courage to try; whether I was being sensible or cowardly, I still don’t know. Besides, I took for granted that Dave would make it. He was more capable in my mind, less likely to cinch himself in indecisive knots.\r\n",
      "Recently, though, Dave told me: “You probably had no idea how much in my own head I was. I know that you, growing up, definitely felt insecure about things, and I think you looked at me and thought, Dave has everything figured out. But I had so much anxiety.” He brought up the tremor he used to have in his hands. I knew about it; in high school, we waited tables together, and I occasionally had to carry out Dave’s soup orders, so he wouldn’t spill. But I guess I thought of the tremor as strictly physiological. I couldn’t see the vulnerability causing it.\r\n",
      "Now, as Dave sprinted away from me and Jon, swatting devil’s club from his path with the rubberized sleeve of his rain jacket, his nerves rose up and rattled him. He worried he wouldn’t be able to find the radio once he got back or know how to turn it on. What if he broke the radio, foreclosing whatever marginal chance we had of getting help? There were lots of ways to screw this up, Dave realized. More occurred to him as he ran.\r\n",
      "He found the radio. He turned it on. Then, having solved these problems, he encountered another he hadn’t anticipated: “What is the appropriate thing you’re supposed to say?” he remembered thinking. On TV, you see a lot of people saying “Mayday.” And so, Dave faced the open water and started broadcasting into the fog: “Mayday, Mayday.” Even in that moment, though, alone on a beach in the middle of nowhere, he felt slightly self-conscious about it. This is so goddamn cliché, he thought.\r\n",
      "Back in the woods, kneeling over Jon, I was having the same problem: I didn’t know what to say. He was lying near a log on his injured side, his beard and glasses flecked with dirt and tendrils of moss. He seemed to be on the brink of losing consciousness. At no time would the possibility of Jon’s dying surface concretely in any of our minds. Still, I knew I was supposed to keep talking to him, to tether him to the world with my voice somehow.\r\n",
      "I started vamping platitudes: We were going to get out of here soon, and so forth. But I could feel myself treading water, even blundering, at one point, into a long-winded apology, worried I overstayed my welcome that one Christmas with his family. I was afraid that the helplessness in my voice might be counterproductive, unsettling Jon instead of steadying him. It was a tremendous silence to fill.\r\n",
      "What can a person say? I had two literature professors in college who made us memorize poems. You never knew when some lines of verse would come in handy, they claimed. One liked to brag that, while traveling through Ireland, he found that if he spat out some Yeats at a pub, he could drink free. This is how I wound up reciting a love poem to Jon.\r\n",
      "It was “The Shampoo,” by Elizabeth Bishop, a lyric poem about the enormity of time, which turns startlingly intimate at the end, when Bishop offers to shampoo her lover’s silvering hair: “Come, let me wash it in this big tin basin,/battered and shiny like the moon.”\r\n",
      "After that, I imagine I also did some W.H. Auden; I knew a fair amount of Auden back then. The stuff in rhyme and meter was always easiest to memorize — “Looking up at the stars, I know quite well/That, for all they care, I can go to hell” — which is why I had a lot of Robert Frost at my disposal as well: “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,”“The Road Not Taken.” For the most part, I trafficked in hits.\r\n",
      "Jon and I would spend about an hour and a half together alone on the forest floor. I ran through everything in my quiver — Kay Ryan, A.R. Ammons, Michael Donaghy — padding each poem with little prefatory remarks, while Jon said nothing, just signaled with his eyes or produced a sound whenever I checked in. I felt like a radio D.J. playing records in the middle of the night, unsure if anyone was listening. And here’s one about owls by Richard Wilbur, I would tell Jon, and off we would go.\r\n",
      "I must have also done at least one by Hayden Carruth, my curmudgeonly pen pal at the literary magazine. Carruth’s poems didn’t lend themselves to memorization, but I’d worked hard to nail one of my favorites, in which he describes stopping to notice a deer standing in an apple thicket, then realizing the northern lights are flaring overhead. Hayden and the animal pass a moment in stillness together. “We are proud to be afraid,” he writes, “proud to share/the silent magnetic storm that destroys the stars.” Relative to that boundless violence above them, he and the deer are momentarily allied, though still not entirely connected: “a glimpse, an acknowledgment/it is enough and never enough.”\r\n",
      "That’s what I said to my friend, powerlessly, tenting my jacket over his face when it started to rain. The title of the poem is: “I Know, I Remember, But How Can I Help You.”\r\n",
      "The Coast Guard cutter Mustang wasn’t where it was supposed to be. The 110-foot patrol boat normally spent its time coursing through the Gulf of Alaska, inspecting halibut-fishing vessels, or circulating, as a terrorist deterrent, near the oil terminals at Valdez. It was home-ported in Seward, hundreds of miles from Glacier Bay. But the crew was transiting to Juneau for a training when, a few days earlier, they were smacked by the same storm that later poured inland, over us. “We had gotten absolutely pummeled,” John Roberts, a petty officer on the Mustang, told me recently. For two days, the boat swished around in 15-foot-plus seas. Many on the crew had been hunkered in the mess deck, vomiting, while Roberts and a couple of his shipmates did their best to cover everyone’s watches. Finally, the Mustang slipped into Glacier Bay to find some protection. The weather started to ease. That afternoon, as Roberts piloted the Mustang east, toward Dundas Bay, his pallid crewmates were finally staggering back up to the bridge, asking where the hell they were.\r\n",
      "That was when Dave’s Mayday call came through. The signal on the Mustang’s radio was thin and faint, barely edging into range. Another of the ship’s petty officers, Eamon McCormack, explained to me that in retrospect the connection feels “mind-boggling.” Glacier Bay National Park extends over more than 5,000 square miles. Our signal would have covered two or three miles at most. And yet, a boat — a Coast Guard boat, no less — happened to be passing through that exceedingly small window at precisely the right time. “I don’t know if, nine times out of 10, you play that over again and the outcome would be the same,” McCormack said. A moment earlier or later — seconds, potentially — and we might have slipped out of alignment. The moving boat would have cruised out of range, uncoupling from us forever.\r\n",
      "It was 1:25 p.m. when the Mustang received Dave’s call, according to one of the subsequent Coast Guard reports. Roberts couldn’t believe it. “Come on, man, I’m tired,” he said aloud, wearily, to the receiver in front of him. Roberts waited for a moment, per protocol, on the off chance that the Coast Guard’s central communications center in Juneau would pick up the call instead. Then he turned and asked his watch commander to pull out all the standardized search-and-rescue paperwork. He was steeling himself, resummoning his professionalism. “I guess we’re doing this,” he said.\r\n",
      "Roberts was the crew member on the Mustang with the most current medical training; he would complete his E.M.T. certification the following month. As he started firing questions at Dave on the radio, he didn’t like the answers that he heard coming back: the shallowness of Jon’s breathing, the likelihood of a punctured lung. More fundamental, Roberts remembered: “Any time a tree falls on somebody, it’s not good.” He was also unsettled to learn that Dave and I both lived in New York City — a red flag, he had found, when someone winds up in trouble in the wilderness.\r\n",
      "We were 100 nautical miles from the nearest hospital; a half-day trip, even in ideal conditions. The Mustang requested that the Coast Guard Air Station in Sitka send a helicopter, but the immediate plan was for Roberts and three crewmates to peel toward shore in the ship’s Zodiac and track us down. Dave had found the flare in Jon’s emergency kit and now, at 2:20, with the Zodiac underway, the Coast Guard asked him to fire it. He was still in front of our campsite, facing the water. He’d never shot off a flare before. He aimed straight up, then watched as the bright tracer rose and arced somewhere far behind him, deep in the woods. He was uncertain whether this counted as a success. He started scanning the fog in front of him, but the Zodiac never appeared.\r\n",
      "Someone on the Mustang caught sight of the flare near the end of its arc and immediately directed the crew on the Zodiac toward it, steering them far away from Dave to the opposite side of the little peninsula we’d camped on. And yet, this was lucky: they wound up coming ashore much closer to where I was waiting in the woods with Jon. Soon, whatever poem I was reciting was interrupted by whistles blowing and voices calling, and eventually three shapes, wearing hard hats and heavy orange rain gear, rushed toward us out of the trees.\r\n",
      "Roberts was especially impressive, a reassuringly large Boston-area native with a booming voice. He knelt and took Jon’s vitals. The information was troubling: his pulse was 60 beats per minute; his breathing, fast and shallow. They put his neck in a brace and eased him onto a kind of truncated backboard, called a Miller board, to move him out to the beach. Dave had returned by then. He and I crouched at one end of the board, near Jon’s feet, as someone — presumably Roberts — bellowed a count of three to lift.\r\n",
      "Later that night, lying down to sleep in a bed-and-breakfast in Gustavus — stunned and depleted, but dry and warm — Dave and I would talk and talk, reviewing the entire ordeal. We had drooped into a long silence, coasting toward sleep, when Dave spoke up with one last observation. When we were getting ready to lift Jon on the backboard, he said, it occurred to him that this was one of those crisis moments you hear about, like when mothers are suddenly able to lift a car off their baby. Dave expected we were going to have superhuman strength.\r\n",
      "We did not have superhuman strength. On Roberts’s command, the men raised Jon to waist height, swiftly and seemingly perfectly level, as though their arms and deltoids were hydraulic. Then, in one motion, they took off downhill, with negligible help from us. This can’t be accurate, but I remember the sensation of being almost dragged, like children in a sled.\r\n",
      "A National Geographic television crew was embedded at the Coast Guard’s air station in Sitka, filming an installment of a thrill-ride reality series. The network had sent crews to other Coast Guard stations around the country too, though this assignment appeared to hold the most dramatic potential. Air Station Sitka was unique: Its pilots were responsible for 12,000 miles of coastline, a sprawling, treacherous wilderness riven with fjords, inlets and glaciers, often buffeted by implacably horrible weather. People who went into the backcountry in Alaska had a way of getting themselves into a different magnitude of trouble, too; as Roberts put it, “When stuff happens in Alaska, it’s big.” Still, this was the television crew’s eighth day in Sitka, and as the show’s producer, Annabelle Hester, explained: “I was having calls with my bosses at headquarters saying, ‘Nothing is happening!’ We were scrambling to come up with Plan B.” Then, the Mustang’s call came in at 1:42.\r\n",
      "“What type of injuries are we looking at?” asked the dispatcher. She was taking the call from behind a semicircular counter, like the reception desk at a midlevel corporate branch office. She had a framed snapshot of a parakeet to brighten her work space, and a photograph of a dog with a heart that said, “I Woof You.” A cameraman stood conspicuously beside her, holding a tense, tight shot.\r\n",
      "“Probable broken ribs, a definite broken arm,” said the man on the other end. Then his voice faltered, seemed to give up: “And whatever else would happen to you if a tree fell on you,” he added.\r\n",
      "The dispatcher retrieved the appropriate paperwork and scribbled “Tree fell on person” on one line. She read the current weather aloud: “30 knots wind, 300 ceiling, heavy rain and one-mile vis.” That would soon be revised: the ceiling had dropped to 100 feet. Entering the weather conditions on one of the Coast Guard incident reports, someone would write, in a kind of nihilistic catchall: “Extremely terrible.”\r\n",
      "The Coast Guard’s policy was to deploy a helicopter within 30 minutes of the initial request, but the Air Station’s operations officer, Cmdr. Karl Baldessari, informed everyone that this mission would take longer to plan. Baldessari was a 25-year veteran of the Coast Guard, a fast-moving, sinewy man in a blousy flight suit, with a tidy mustache and spiky hair. His role at the air station was that of a firehouse chief. He was responsible for the safety of everyone working there, which meant making judicious decisions about what warranted sending them hurtling through the sky.\r\n",
      "That calculus got knotty in conditions like these, though there was a baseline volatility to flying in Alaska at all. The Coast Guard didn’t let its helicopter pilots fly lead out of Sitka, no matter how much experience they had at other air stations, until they practiced difficult landings at specific locations in the region and got their egos battered a little by logging a full winter in the state. Visibility in Alaska was frequently poor; conditions changed quickly. One pilot told me about blindly tunneling through fog in the dark when his co-pilot got “caged”: The man lifted his eyes momentarily from his instruments and, without any visual references or a horizon to latch onto, found it impossible to reorient himself, lost all sense of direction and was felled by vertigo.\r\n",
      "During much of the year it was also cold enough, with sufficient moisture in the air, that ascending to clear the region’s many minor mountains or even just flying through a cloud risked the aircraft’s icing up. To mitigate this, the Coast Guard had laid out virtual “track lines” across the entirety of their range: a grid of GPS points and a network of paths connecting them, along which pilots could chart a course and fly at a relatively low altitude, confident they weren’t going to smash into a mountain. The system wasn’t comprehensive; the track lines got the pilots close to their destination, but ultimately they had to diverge from this GPS superhighway and fly the remaining distance the old-fashioned way, with their radar and eyes. It was like taking an exit off the interstate, except there might be a granite wall in front of you wherever you chose to get off. It was possible the pilots would travel very far — a half-mile away from whoever needed their help — only to discover that the last leg was too risky and be forced to turn back.\r\n",
      "Baldessari gathered the two pilots on duty that afternoon and the Air Station’s flight surgeon, then unrolled a large paper map. He pointed to our location, explaining: “That’s probably one of the lousiest places we fly in and out of. This Inian Pass, right here, is the worst place we could possibly go.”\r\n",
      "Inian Pass is a slim channel near the center of the Icy Strait, the long, interconnected system of waterways stretching through Glacier Bay. Conditions in the Icy Strait can be bad 300 days of the year, Baldessari recently told me; wind, rain and storm surges all push through it fast from the open ocean. But Inian Pass is a narrow keyhole at the center of the strait — a mile-wide opening between a few uninhabited islands and a rocky point — where all that weather speeds up. The only way for the pilots to reach us would be to fly straight through it.\r\n",
      "Nothing in the National Geographic footage, at this point, feels reassuring. The flight surgeon holds his hand over his mouth and bites his lip. The co-pilot, Chris Ferguson, only a few months into his posting in Alaska, mills around and fidgets with his ear. It’s obvious Baldessari needs convincing. He wasn’t eager to send his men up if he didn’t have to and wasn’t certain they would make it all the way there if he did.\r\n",
      "“It’s kind of funny,” he told the pilots, pointing at the map. “You’ve got a boat right here.”\r\n",
      "Lying on his backboard like a burl of driftwood, Jon was conscious and cognizant of his pain, but he had started to feel somehow buffered from his body, uninterested in connecting with the world beyond it. He would later describe himself as a “thinking blob. It was a very passive experience.” He didn’t know what was happening but could tell our momentum had stalled. He was confused and felt impatient. In his mind, the three of us had solved the impossible problem: We’d managed to get help. This was supposed to be the simple part, when everyone rushed him to the hospital. Instead, his condition deteriorated. Within 10 minutes of reaching the beach, Jon threw up. I’d never seen anything like it, a kind of dark purple gristle. I took out my wool cap to wipe his face, and he retched a second time, straight into my hat.\r\n",
      "“I got that all over me,” John Roberts told me recently. He’d seen vomit like that before; it meant Jon had ingested a fair amount of blood and signaled internal injuries. It made Roberts anxious. He had been on the Mustang for two and a half years at that point but had spent the previous four years in Palm Beach, a busy but less extreme posting that often involved rescuing weekend boaters from relatively close to shore — and where, Roberts pointed out, the water is warm and won’t necessarily kill you if you go in. Moreover, the bulk of the Coast Guard’s training is for maritime rescues, not rescues on land. Counterintuitive as it sounds, Roberts’s comfort level and confidence had dropped significantly once he hopped off the Zodiac and set foot on the beach.\r\n",
      "He reported back to the Mustang that Jon had thrown up, then soon radioed again, explaining that Jon was going into shock. He kept giving and requesting updates, trying to gauge how long this might take, and eventually started erecting a makeshift shelter out of plastic sheeting and medical tape, hoping to keep Jon out of the rain. Out of earshot of us, Roberts explained to his crew mate Eamon McCormack what the vomit meant: The possibility of Jon dying, here under their care, was real. At one point in the National Geographic footage, as Roberts’s calls are relayed to the air station in Sitka, you can see where the dispatcher clearly writes on her form: “E.M.T. does not feel comfortable.”\r\n",
      "By this time, the air station’s flight surgeon had received enough information to be alarmed. “It sounds like he’s got a pretty significant chest injury,” he told Baldessari. Baldessari understood they would need to launch a helicopter but warned the Mustang that the aircraft might not make it through the weather; ultimately it would be the pilots’ call, once they veered off their last track line and tried to shoot through Inian Pass.\r\n",
      "They would go and give it a look, Baldessari explained over the radio, but the outlook was iffy. The guys on the beach, he said, must be prepared to get Jon back on their cutter and haul him to a hospital themselves, as fast as they could.\r\n",
      "One evening this winter, my phone rang, and it was Karl Baldessari. Long retired from the Coast Guard, he was teaching aviation at a community college in Oregon, where I left a voice mail message earlier that day. I meanwhile had metamorphosed into a 40-year-old father of two and fumbled to explain to Baldessari that, as thrilled as I was to have tracked him down, I was, at the moment, racing to finish a risotto for my daughters before gymnastics practice and would have to call him back. Without missing a beat, Baldessari blared orders at me, joking, but still sounding as instinctually in charge as he did in the National Geographic footage: “O.K.,” he said, “you want to stir it constantly, but slowly!”\r\n",
      "I didn’t expect any of the Coast Guardsmen I was cold-calling to remember that day. However dramatic it remained for me, I assumed it would have been obscured in a yearslong wash of more sensational incidents. But everyone I spoke to did remember it, immediately and in detail. Baldessari had been involved in hundreds of rescue operations during his 30-year career, and yet, as I stood at the stove on the phone that evening, he told me: “The moment I listened to your voice mail, I knew exactly the case! It was almost like it was yesterday.”\r\n",
      "There was something about the supreme freakishness of the accident that left a lasting impression. For those who came ashore, the experience was also marked by a feeling of subtly escalating chaos and the pressure to surmount it. McCormack told me that ours was a story he retold endlessly, often to the younger Coast Guardsmen he was eventually tasked with training. In it was a lesson about “not taking situations that look impossible at face value,” he said. “When things start to go wrong, don’t panic or lose sight of what resources you’ve got.” Keep working the problem until its absolute end — even, McCormack added, if it means deviating from official policy.\r\n",
      "McCormack was not supposed to be landing an inflatable boat on an unforgivably rocky Alaskan shoreline, for example. But there he was, anyway, beaching the Zodiac as gingerly as he could, so that Roberts and the other men could load Jon aboard. They slid him in on his side “like a folder into a filing cabinet,” as Jon put it, and started motoring through the chop, very cautiously, back to the Mustang, about a mile away.\r\n",
      "As relieved as Jon had been when the Coast Guard first arrived, he also felt instantaneously more vulnerable. Strapped to the back board, his neck in the collar, he surrendered control of his body, however imperfect that control had been. He was being hauled around as an object now, with no ability to wriggle or shift positions, to manage his pain or even to turn his head and see what was happening. He was helpless, entirely dependent on the upright people operating around him, those voices he could hear discussing him on the far side of some gauzy divide. About 10 minutes into the trip on the Zodiac, Jon heard one of those voices say, “Oh, shit, we’re losing air.”\r\n",
      "A section of the Zodiac’s sponson — the inflatable fender that wraps around the boat — had punctured. One side was completely deflated. “It’s a big deal,” McCormack recently explained to me, sounding surprised that I had to ask. The sponson increases the boat’s buoyancy and stability, as well as keeping water from cresting over the side; under normal conditions, a Zodiac with a broken sponson would have been taken out of service automatically. Instead, McCormack found the puncture and wedged the nozzle of a small pump inside. Then — steering the boat with one hand, operating the throttle with the other — he started working the pump with his foot, essentially doing leg presses, to keep the fender partly inflated. The ride was already bumpy in four-foot seas. Now McCormack began tracing a slow, zigzagging course, doing what he could to tamp down the turbulence and the violence to Jon’s spine, as well as to guard against the possibility of the injured man’s suddenly bounding over the side on his backboard.\r\n",
      "Roberts and the other Coast Guardsmen on the Zodiac leaned over Jon to shield him from the splash. The pain was heinous; Jon seemed to be passing out. Roberts talked to him, held his hand. Roberts felt crushed, he told me; he was torturing this guy in order to save him. When they finally reached the Mustang, rather than hoist Jon off the Zodiac, they swung the ship’s crane around and simply lifted the entire boat out of the water, level with the deck, and then carried him aboard, to keep from joggling him any more.\r\n",
      "McCormack eventually returned for me and Dave, and a half-hour later we were reunited with Jon in the Mustang’s athwartship passageway, a cramped, steel hallway, like the space between two cars of a train. Jon was still battened to the backboard, wedged up to keep the weight of his body on his less-painful side. They had cut off his clothes, though he’d murmured a plea not to — he was wearing a brand-new Patagonia jacket that he had borrowed from a friend — then swaddled him in a hypothermia blanket. Dave and I knelt and rubbed his feet.\r\n",
      "The helicopter was going to make it. I don’t remember there being a grand announcement. I’m not sure we were ever made aware of the possibility that it wouldn’t. Now the crew got busy below: tying down anything that could be blown off by the rotor wash or stashing it in the mess. I also don’t remember hearing the helicopter when it finally arrived. Instead, I remember only a heavy door to our left swinging open to reveal, like a scene from an action movie, the silhouette of a man in a blue flight suit, feet planted shoulder-width apart to steady himself as the ship rocked sideways. The cable he’d been lowered on drew back into the ocean spray and fog behind him. “I’m flight surgeon Russ Bowman,” he said and stepped inside.\r\n",
      "Bowman took Jon’s vitals and gave him several, successive shots of morphine. Soon, everyone was working to squeeze him back through the narrow doorway and onto the deck where the helicopter, an MH-60 Jayhawk, was idling overhead.\r\n",
      "Until recently, the story I told about the accident unfolded in two basic acts: the tree fell, instantaneously unleashing a kind of unfathomable chaos; then the Coast Guard appeared and, just as swiftly, regathered that chaos into order. It was like watching footage of an exploding object, then watching it run in reverse. The maneuver the Coast Guard was readying to execute now, on the deck of the Mustang, would be the climax of that progression.\r\n",
      "The helicopter hovered 30 or 40 feet over the boat, mirroring its speed and trajectory, while both vehicles moved slowly forward. “Looks like you’re heading for a rain squall,” the co-pilot, Chris Ferguson, radioed the Mustang at one point, and asked the ship to adjust its course, to keep them in as forgiving weather as possible. Soon the flight mechanic was calling out instructions to tuck the aircraft into alignment: “Forward and right 30. Forward and right 20. Forward and right 10.” Then, finally — speaking, in the flight recordings, with an almost galling air of imperturbability — the lead helicopter pilot, Rich McIntyre, radioed the flight mechanic to begin the hoist.\r\n",
      "The whole procedure, from our vantage point, seemed seamless and routine. In a way, it was: After the agonized deliberation at the air station, the pilots exited off their GPS route into fairly manageable conditions around Inian Pass. The winds were workable; the water wasn’t excessively choppy. Ultimately, scooping Jon off the deck of the Mustang would resemble a standard exercise that the pilots drilled in their trainings. “Not to dumb it down,” the co-pilot, Chris Ferguson, told me — plucking someone with a spinal injury off a moving boat and hoisting them into a moving helicopter is a pretty insane thing to do. “But we normalize what isn’t normal.”\r\n",
      "A few moments earlier, as the men scurried around Jon on his backboard, packaging and fastening him for the hoist, Jon worried that the second he got airborne he would start twirling uncontrollably, like the feathery end of a cat toy, and potentially thwack his head on the equipment on deck. But now, he was levitating smoothly — a solitary, swaddled bale of a man, perfectly perpendicular to the ground. Dave and I watched it happen: our friend rising steadily away from us, improbably, to safety. As Jon floated higher, he could hear the Coast Guardsmen on the Mustang beneath him begin to cheer. He felt it was safe to open his eyes. When he did, he saw someone, hunched in the open cargo door of the helicopter, pointing a television camera at him.\r\n",

      "Jon was rushed into surgery at the hospital in Sitka that evening. He’d punctured both lungs, one to the point of collapse, sustained multiple fractures on eight of his ribs, broken several vertebrae, shattered his left shoulder blade and snapped his brachial plexus nerves. His spleen had been macerated into countless flecks. After awakening from surgery, Jon was disappointed that the doctors had swept those shards into a bag and thrown his spleen in the trash; he wanted to get a look at it, maybe even keep it preserved in a jar, alongside his cyborg-banana.\r\n",
      "Once back in Gustavus, Dave and I realized that we would need to call Jon’s parents in Switzerland. I didn’t have to push the job on Dave this time; he was adamant. He felt he would need to face conversations like these if he was going to be a doctor. It was Jon’s father who picked up, and after absorbing the news, he paused and caught Dave off guard. “Thank you,” he said solemnly. “You guys saved my son’s life.”\r\n",
      "Dave’s stomach dropped. “I remember thinking about it,” he told me recently, “and realizing, Yeah. I guess, logistically, we did.” I had the same reaction when Dave hung up the phone and, clearly shaken, relayed his conversation to me. Until that moment, the idea that we saved Jon’s life had never occurred to us, possibly because the idea that Jon might have died still hadn’t occurred to us. We had zero sense of accomplishment, or even agency. In our minds, all we did was avoid screwing up until the real help could arrive and save him.\r\n",
      "But Jon hadn’t absorbed the story that way. From the instant he willed himself out of the water, he felt all of us locking into that same seamless flow of order steadily displacing chaos that Dave and I only experienced once the Coast Guard arrived. It was amazing to him how the three of us managed to generate solutions for each successive problem. Even my reciting those poems, which to me had always felt like a moment of utter helplessness, became, in Jon’s telling, a perfect emblem of that streak of serendipitous problem-solving. “You conveyed a calmness,” he told me recently. “I remember it being this nice moment.” He added that if he ever has to spend two hours dying on a remote forest floor again, having me there to recite poetry would be one of his top ways to do it.\r\n",
      "The feeling of inevitability that day became only more pronounced for Jon as time passed and the entire story of our rescue receded into a prologue to the rest of his life. The surgery in Sitka was only the first of half a dozen, and it would take several years for him to regain 60 percent of the use of his arm, wrist and hand, as the nerves gradually regrew along his injured side. He was in good enough shape to go back to Alaska the summer after the accident — repairing boats in the company’s warehouse and occasionally helping out at the bed-and-breakfast — but he struggled. He could repair kayaks but needed help lifting them. He was unable to wrestle the mattress corners into the fitted sheets when he made the beds. After that, he started working at a recording studio in Portland, just as he envisioned while stuck in the water, and he now runs his own audio-mastering company: Spleenless Mastering.\r\n",
      "Eventually Jon seemed to have recovered from the accident without any conspicuous disabilities. But his life has been quietly corroded by chronic pain and, almost equally, by the stresses of navigating the doctors, medications (and their side effects) to manage it. About two years after the accident, he learned he had PTSD. The trauma wasn’t the falling tree, but his experience of powerlessness as a perpetual patient in the American medical system. It manifested as a kind of unbearable empathy for anyone who was suffering. Jon found himself shouting at doctors, on his own behalf but also on behalf of strangers in waiting rooms who weren’t being seen. He would hear interviews with natural-disaster victims or the homeless on NPR and have to pull his car over. There continued to be other tribulations, too — more mundane ones. A few times a year, he still rebreaks a rib out of nowhere; once or twice, Jon told me, all it has taken is an especially affectionate hug from his wife.\r\n",
      "Jon found early on that he could cordon off this suffering, both in his own mind and in conversation, by making jokes about the accident itself and sticking to the happy ending of our rescue, a trick that got much easier after the National Geographic show aired later that year. “Mission Rescue: Final Frontier,” the program was called. The soundtrack was all heart-thwacking synth drums and shredding guitar. A foreboding, Ken Burns-effected snapshot of Dave and Jon looking joyful before the trip gave way to a whirring re-enactment of someone else’s legs — cast in the role of Dave’s legs — sprinting through the blurry woods for our radio. A melodramatic narrator pondered the fate of “Kayaker Jon Cohrs.”\r\n",
      "Initially, the schlockiness of the production felt like a blessing. The show depersonalized the accident, giving us all a shorthand to convey how dramatic that day had been, without confronting how destabilizing and senseless it might have felt. At a party, you could lay out the basics — a tree fell on Jon — then say, “National Geographic even made a TV special about it,” and everyone would go wide-eyed but then move on, figuring you would unspool the real story some other time.\r\n",
      "But we never realized the degree to which that kitschy shorthand started to obscure the real story — then, gradually, to replace it. I’m embarrassed to admit that, though Jon and I have remained close, I did not know the extent to which he has continued to suffer for the last 17 years until talking to him for several hours in order to write this account.\r\n",
      "The morning after the accident, Dave and I traveled back to Dundas Bay to pack up our campsite and collect the kayaks we abandoned the previous evening. We were shuttled there from Gustavus by the same boat captain who dropped us off three days earlier, a forbiddingly taciturn commercial fisherman named Doug Ogilvy.\r\n",
      "The tide in the cove was way out when we arrived; it was, as Ogilvy put it, “a suck-ass beach.” The approach was so shallow that he had to drop anchor a hundred yards or more from shore. He asked if we had waders. We did not. So Ogilvy put on his, climbed down the ladder and told Dave to get on his back. Then stoically, like an ox or an old-timey strongman hauling a safe, he trudged through the thigh-high water, dropped Dave on the gravel beach, then lurched back and hauled me the same way, as if I were a man-size infant in a papoose.\r\n",
      "Dave told me he’d had a strange feeling on the ride out, as if we would discover that an even more massive tree had fallen on our tent since we last slept there and that all three of us would have been crushed and killed if we’d spent another night in Dundas Bay, as planned. That is, he half-expected to find evidence that the accident had been fortuitous somehow, that there was a reason, or redemptive value, behind it. My mother had the same instinct when I called her the night before. On the phone I strained to emphasize for her — she was only two years into her cruelly premature widowhood, and I was new at being the overprotective son of a widow — that Jon was going to be all right, and that Dave and I were safe. She told me that my dad must have been up there looking out for us somehow.\r\n",
      "I resented all the supernatural thinking. If it comforted other people, fine, but I’d somehow known right away that I didn’t need a reason for the accident. It was senseless, but straightforward, as unequivocal a fact as my father’s death had been. A tree fell in the woods. It might not have, but it did. Jon could have died, but he didn’t. Other possibilities spiraled infinitely outward from there, though apparently I wasn’t too interested in contemplating them. As strange as it sounds, it was years before I realized that the tree could have hit me — and only after a friend pointed this out, as I told the story around a fire one night. And it was only a few weeks ago, while on the phone with Jon, that it occurred to me that the tree could have hit all three of us — we were standing in a single-file line, after all, waiting to cross the creek — and that we all might have wound up clobbered and scattered in that river, dying slowly and watching each other die.\r\n",
      "It’s also probably true that I helped preclude these possibilities by being so feverishly paranoid about bears, wheeling around at the sound of the snapping roots. That’s what allowed me to see the tree coming, just barely, and scream that infinitesimal heads-up for Dave. And so, the real meaning of the accident, if I felt compelled to find one, might be that it validated my most exaggerated fears. But instead, it somehow helped cleanse me of them. There was comfort for me in accepting the arbitrariness of what happened, in regarding it as a spasm of random damage in time and space that, just as randomly, a small number of human beings got the opportunity to repair. We were more capable than I had understood. We were also far more helpless.\r\n",
      "On the ride back to Gustavus with our gear, I pictured myself, again, as a small blip in empty space. The ride was rough and jumpy as Ogilvy impatiently pounded his boat through the last vestigial wave energy of the storm; Dave and I had to hold on, to plant ourselves on the bench behind him. But there was a moment when I felt so safe that I loosened my grip, leaned slightly into the motion of the boat, and, closing my eyes, felt myself lift off the seat.\r\n",

      "Content:  274 Matt Villano, CNN, Video by Joshua Sarlo and Gabe JohnsonPublished 7th March 2019\r\n",
      "Los Angeles (CNN) It's a Saturday in the outskirts of Los Angeles, and about 50 people are ready to board an airplane for a colorful and memorable journey back to the 1970s.\r\n",
      "Compared to most international flights, this one is short -- only four hours. And though the flight will transport everyone on the passenger list to another place and time, it logs a whopping total of zero air miles, as it never actually leaves the ground.\r\n",
      "Welcome to the wild and wonderful world of the Pan Am Experience. One-part re-enactment, one-part dinner theater and one-part memorabilia overload, the attraction mixes top-quality food with elaborate detail to recreate what it was like to fly a Boeing 747 with one of the world's most beloved airlines long before its bankruptcy and dissolution in 1991.\r\n",
      "\"People always talk about how it's not the destination but the journey that's important,\" says Talaat Captan, who co-founded the experience with Anthony Toth back in 2014. \r\n",
      "\"We believe that. People come to us to travel somewhere and not go anywhere. To them, the value is in the experience.\"\r\n",
      "This summer marks the five-year anniversary of the attraction, and it has gotten more elaborate every year. Props have become more authentic. Actors have developed characters. There's also now a fashion show, and the uniforms represent one of the largest collections of vintage flight attendant uniforms anywhere in the world. \r\n",
      "The Pan Am Experience is as close as you can get to experiencing Pan Am without engaging in actual time travel, which is why people are so keen to climb aboard they book their seats months in advance. \r\n",
      "The experience begins outside a row of warehouse buildings in Pacoima, an L.A. suburb near Santa Clarita. Guests enter from the parking lot on a red carpet and find a studio decked out like a 1960s airplane terminal. In one corner: A series of airline ticket counters, including an exact replica (computer and all) of a Pan Am desk from the era. On the other side: A lounge that comprises circular bars surrounded by stools and furniture made from old airplane parts.\r\n",
      "The back of the room is lined with a screen depicting the exterior of a Pan Am 747, circa 1971.\r\n",
      "Guests check in at the Pan Am desk with Captan, who gives them paper boarding passes exactly like the originals from back in the day. A gate agent ushers them to the lounge, where drinks are complimentary.\r\n",
      "About an hour in, a voice blares over the crackling loudspeaker: \"Would the flight crew please report to the ticket counter?\"\r\n",
      "Without missing a beat, \"Captain\" Toth and 14 \"flight attendants\" dressed in vintage garb enter and head to the ticket counter for their \"assignments.\" Crew members then proceed up a jet bridge toward the plane screen in the back of the studio, open a cabin door and invite guests to join them. Their message is clear: All aboard!\r\n",
      "Flight attendants seat guests in one of three sections of the plane: Clipper Class, which was the original business class; First Class; and the Upper Deck Lounge, which historically was part of First. \r\n",
      "Once everyone is comfortable, the \"purser\" gives a series of announcements, and flight attendants go through safety demonstrations. The script is a mix of throwback warnings and modern wit: \"Unless we have an earthquake tonight, there won't be much movement, so your seat belt isn't really necessary.\"\r\n",
      "After a welcome video from Toth, flight attendants wheel out magazine carts, distribute magazines, take drink orders and bring hot towels in buckets of dry ice, creating an almost magical smoke.\r\n",
      "Finally, the meal begins. A white-jacketed maître-d brings out menus. Flight attendants pull out retractable tables and set them with Pan Am-branded tablecloths, dishes and silverware. Upper Deck Lounge guests get a caviar course first. Then everyone chooses between appetizers of shrimp cocktail and caprese salad.\r\n",
      "Following a fashion show of Pan Am uniforms from the late 1960s and early '70s, a throwback dinner is served: Chateaubriand sliced tableside or roast chicken, both served with carrots, green beans and potatoes. (There's a pasta option for vegetarians, too.) As guests eat, disco plays on the cabin speaker system. \r\n",
      "Trivia and another fashion show of uniforms from the 1980s follow dinner, leading into a wine-and-cheese course, Cognac, coffee and chocolate mousse cake or fruit tart for dessert.\r\n",
      "A third and final fashion show of airline uniforms from all over the world closes the night.\r\n",
      "Cigarettes and other details\r\n",
      "Throughout the experience, it's clear that Toth and Captan have spared no expense to make the flight authentic.\r\n",
      "That means the seatbelt buckles are original, complete with the Pan Am globe logo etched into the top. It also means each of the table floral arrangements has sprigs of baby's breath, just like the arrangements of the 1970s. \r\n",
      "Even the cigarettes -- props that puff smoke when you blow them -- are eerily lifelike.\r\n",
      "\"Back in the 1970s, everybody on board airplanes smoked,\" says Toth. \"There was no way we were going to recreate this experience without trying to recreate that.\"\r\n",
      "Drink offerings include 1970s-approved Harvey Wallbangers and Tab soda. Hot towels smell the way they used to: Flight attendants soak them in some of the same scents as Pan Am used historically. The seat fabrics reflect the fading sun and moon designs of the day.\r\n",
      "Another mind-boggling detail from the original Pan Am planes: The \"nose wall,\" a needlepoint artwork at the front of the First-Class cabin that depicts a sailboat on the water on a sunny afternoon. \r\n",
      "For guests who have a history with the airline -- former flight attendants or family members of former Pan Am employees -- these tiny touches are more than an appreciated detail; they're a link to the past.\r\n",
      "\"As soon as I saw the First-Class cabin, I started crying,\" says Michelle Fedder, who started her 30-year career as a flight attendant with Pan Am and recently met three former colleagues here. \"It was like they took my memories out of my brain and brought them back to life.\"\r\n",
      "Brice Cooper, creative director at Pan American World Airways, the New Hampshire company that licenses Pan Am trademarks worldwide, agrees.\r\n",
      "\"What they've done here in recreating the vibe and feel of flying on Pan Am is nothing short of remarkable,\" he says.\r\n",
      "The Pan Am Experience is really Toth's brainchild. \r\n",
      "The 52-year-old has been obsessed with planes since his childhood, and fell in love with Pan Am while flying to Europe one summer to visit his grandparents in Italy. He acquired his first pair of airplane seats when he was 16, and started making trips to the airplane graveyard in the Mojave Desert to buy airplane parts in his 20s.\r\n",
      "Eventually, he had enough parts to build the ground floor of the 22-foot-long Pan Am set in his garage. He moved the set to a storage facility so he could break out his prized spiral staircase and create a second floor.\r\n",
      "That first set forms the bones of the Pan Am Experience today.\r\n",
      "Sometime around 2014, after the ill-fated television show, \"Pan Am,\" mutual friends connected Toth and Captan, who had heard about the set and wanted to see it up close. He was blown away.\r\n",
      "Captan, a long-time movie producer, had the idea to use the set to host an event, and a trial dinner sold out at an aviation memorabilia collectors' show in a matter of minutes. Demand was so high, the duo ended up hosting more events. Later that year, Captan moved Toth's set into Air Hollywood, his aviation-themed film studio here. The Pan Am Experience has been flying high ever since. \r\n",
      "Nowadays, the Pan Am Experience takes off every Saturday at 6 p.m. sharp, and about half are open to the public. Tickets for the dinners are sold in pairs and range in price from $475 to $875, depending on seating class. \r\n",
      "The next two public dinners scheduled for March 9 and March 23 are sold out, and there's a waiting list for dinners later in the year.\r\n",
      "Captan and Toth hope to open an outpost in Las Vegas.\r\n",
      "Details of the expansion are still under development, but Captan says the new experience likely would include turbulence and white noise. More seats on the set and a separate bar and gift shop open to the public throughout the week also are likely. \r\n",
      "\"My hope is that people who never got a chance to fly Pan Am get an opportunity to see how fantastic air travel was back in the era, while those who might have been able to experience it bring back memories that remind them of the good old days,\" says Toth. \"This is a part of our history worth celebrating.\"\r\n",

      "The ground shook horizontally and vertically for up to 10 seconds, most strongly in an area 30 miles (48 kilometers) in diameter around LA's Northridge neighborhood, according to the public-private partnership Earthquake Country Alliance . It was felt as far away as Las Vegas.\r\n",
      "DEATHS AND INJURIES\r\n",
      "The state said at least 57 died in the earthquake, though a study issued the following year put the death toll at 72, including heart attacks. About 9,000 were injured.\r\n",
      "The greatest concentration of deaths occurred at the Northridge Meadows, a 163-unit apartment complex where 16 people were killed when it collapsed onto the parking area below, crushing first-floor apartments.\r\n",
      "The catastrophe at Northridge Meadows revealed a particular seismic hazard due to so-called soft-story construction in which a building's ground level has large open areas for purposes such as parking spots or shop windows.\r\n",
      "DAMAGE\r\n",
      "The widespread damage to buildings, freeways and infrastructure made the Northridge quake the costliest U.S. disaster at the time.\r\n",
      "According to Earthquake Country Alliance, 82,000 residential and commercial units and 5,400 mobile homes were damaged or destroyed, nine parking structures toppled, nine hospitals were evacuated due to structural or other problems, seven key freeway bridges collapsed, and hundreds more were damaged.\r\n",
      "Some 200 steel-frame high-rises sustained cracked welds.\r\n",
      "Among vivid images from the quake were scenes of vehicles stranded high on an elevated section of freeway with the road fallen away in front and behind, and the wrecked motorcycle of a police officer who plunged to his death off the end of a broken overpass while rushing to work in the early morning darkness.\r\n",
      "The California Department of Transportation, which had already retrofitted many of the bridges that ended up being damaged, would spend hundreds of millions of dollars to further strengthen numerous bridges identified as being at risk.\r\n",
      "The damage to hospitals led the state to require strengthening of those buildings.\r\n",
      "LEGACY\r\n",
      "Since Northridge there has been a push toward progress sometimes frustratingly slow on everything from making buildings safer to increasing society's overall ability to deal with seismic threats.\r\n",
      "In 2008, an annual earthquake drill known as the Great ShakeOut began in Southern California to teach the basic safety technique of \"drop, cover and hold on.\" Initially based on a scenario of a magnitude 7.8 quake on the southern end of the mighty San Andreas fault, the drill has since spread across the United States and around the world.\r\n",
      "In 2015, Los Angeles enacted a mandatory retrofit ordinance aimed at preventing loss of life in major earthquakes at the city's most vulnerable buildings. It covered about 13,500 \"soft-story\" buildings like Northridge Meadows and some 1,500 buildings with \"non-ductile reinforced concrete\" construction.\r\n",
      "The ordinance, however, allowed a process spanning seven years for retrofitting of soft-story buildings and 25 years for non-ductile reinforced concrete buildings.\r\n",
      "Last year, the U.S. Geological Survey announced its fledgling West Coast earthquake early warning system was ready for broad use by businesses, utilities, transportation systems and schools after years of development and testing of prototypes. The system detects the start of an earthquake and sends alerts that can give warnings ranging from several seconds to a minute before shaking arrives, depending on distance from the epicenter. That can be enough time to slow trains, stop industrial processes and allow students to scramble under desks.\r\n",
      "This month, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti unveiled a mobile app that uses the early warning system to alert Los Angeles County residents when there is an earthquake of magnitude 5.0 or greater. Other mobile apps are in development.\r\n",
      "Also this month, the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. released a guide aimed at helping businesses minimize disruptions from major earthquakes, taking advantage of information technologies such as the digital cloud to keep a company working even if its physical systems are destroyed or inaccessible.\r\n",

      "Content:  294 In the fall of 2017, as José Andrés and an untold number of volunteers were preparing millions of hot meals for Puerto Ricans following Hurricane Maria, the celebrity chef realized that the hunger that swept across the island was not just the result of a powerful Category 4 storm. It was the result of a natural disaster plus some man-made ones.\r\n",
      "Puerto Rico, in short, could not feed itself before the hurricane hit, let alone after it.\r\n",
      "More than a year after Maria made landfall, World Central Kitchen the nonprofit organization that Andrés founded after the Haiti earthquake in 2010 and many other organizations are working with small farmers, ranchers, fish co-ops and food-related businesses to rebuild the islands agricultural economy. They want to make it more food secure and help it recover faster when disaster strikes. They all seem to have absorbed an important lesson in the wake of Maria: If they cant trust the territorial government to help after a disaster, they better rely on themselves.\r\n",
      "Hillary &amp; I spent yesterday visiting with Puerto Ricans who are rebuilding their communities, from innovative farmers, to small-business owners, to ecologists restoring habitats. It's encouraging. We all should redouble our efforts to help the people of Puerto Rico. pic.twitter.com/URiilcNa9o\r\n",
      "— Bill Clinton (@BillClinton) January 29, 2019\r\n",
      "This is a very rich island in terms of water and in terms of weather to grow things, said Andrés, on a call from Puerto Rico, where he, among other things, gave former president Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton a tour of a farm that World Central Kitchen is helping.\r\n",
      "[Food José Andrés is nominated for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, congressman confirms]\r\n",
      "Puerto Rico should be producing more than 15 percent of its food, the Nobel Peace Prize nominee said. I think Puerto Rico has the potential to produce 40 percent.\r\n",
      "Perhaps a little background would be helpful to understand how Puerto Rico became so reliant on others for food. The reasons are complicated, but they include some 20th-century government initiatives and a population that generally looked down on farming as a profession.\r\n",
      "During and after World War II, the U.S. territory decided that, to jump-start its faltering economy, the island needed to move away from agriculture (one rooted in sugar cane and an archaic plantation system) and instead invest in manufacturing. People soon abandoned the countryside, where agriculture was considered peasant work, and moved to the cities. Or they left the island altogether. As a result, by the time Maria made landfall, Puerto Rico was importing about 85 percent of its food and relying heavily on the mainland United States for meats, dairy, vegetables and more. The quality of these products could be low, and the prices high.\r\n",
      "[José Andréss riveting We Fed an Island calls for a revolution in disaster relief]\r\n",
      "Its not surprising, then, that Puerto Ricans have fretted for years that a major disaster could threaten the islands fragile food system, which relies on ships and vulnerable shipping lanes to ferry products to its shores. Maria was that disaster, and Andrés served as a witness to the crippling effects the storm had on the islands ability to feed itself.\r\n",
      "Fast forward to 2019: After serving more than 3.7 million meals across the island, World Central Kitchen is trying to help Puerto Ricans serve themselves. WCKs Plow to Plate program, which debuted in September on the first anniversary of Marias landfall, is designed to help small farmers recover from natural disasters. It is also meant to help growers increase their capacity and connect them with distributors and buyers, all of which have, historically, been problems for small Puerto Rican farmers who have had to compete against larger-scale operations.\r\n",
      "In the four months since it was launched, Plow to Plate has awarded more than $540,000 in grants to 35 small farmers and food-related businesses to help expand the smallholder agricultural economy on the island, noted Nate Mook, executive director of World Central Kitchen. The money will help recipients build out basic infrastructure, whether greenhouses, irrigation systems or coolers to keep produce fresh until its sold or delivered.\r\n",
      "The recipient list will soon multiply, thanks to the Clinton Global Initiative, which has committed $2 million to World Central Kitchen, Andrés announced Tuesday afternoon from the stage of the CGI Action Network Post-Disaster Recovery meeting in San Juan. World Central Kitchen plans to match CGIs commitment and channel most of the $4 million, over a five-year period, into 213 small farms and other food-related businesses, Mook said. The rest will be invested in agricultural and business skills training, as well as an agritourism program that will place volunteers on farms and businesses around the island.\r\n",
      "[This is an emergency: José Andrés to open relief kitchen for federal workers during shutdown]\r\n",
      "The announcement of CGIs investment came a day after the Clintons toured Cosechas Tierra Viva, a small farm in eastern Puerto Rico, which is funneling its grant money into modern technology to conserve natural resources and increase yields, according to a recent Forbes story.\r\n",
      "On stage at the CGI Action Network meeting, Bill Clinton called Cosechas Tierra Viva amazing and impressive. Its owners, the former president said, basically said that they want to bring the Internet of things to small farmers. ... Little family farmers could be just as productive as big ones because of technology.\r\n",
      "Andrés is more modest in what he hopes WCKs involvement will mean for agriculture in Puerto Rico. Yes, he thinks the island has the potential to grow 40 percent of its food, but Andrés also supports the Puerto Rican governments goal to reduce imported food from 85 percent to 70 percent. He also wants to help diversify the crops grown on the island and introduce plants, such as a variety of breadfruit, that can withstand pests, droughts and other acts of nature.\r\n",
      "But make no mistake, Andrés said: When a hurricane like Maria hits, all of the islands crops are going to be wiped out. The key, he added, is to build resiliency into the system. One way is to develop hydroponic farms, which could be dismantled and placed in weatherproof containers ahead of a storm, Andrés said. Such farms would not have to start over from scratch and, more important, they could begin feeding locals soon after a disaster.\r\n",
      "Its not just one answer that covers it, Andrés said. Its a bunch of little things that happen to help Puerto Rico move forward.\r\n",
      "One of World Central Kitchens more forward-thinking moves is to fund small farms that also have kitchens on site. These farms will be strategically located across the island. They will serve a purpose when the next major storm hits Puerto Rico, Andrés said. Their kitchens will be quickly transformed into relief operations to feed hungry Puerto Ricans just like in 2017, but without all the chaos and improvisation.\r\n",

      "The fundraiser raised $3.5 million at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. Some individual plates cost $10,000 at most, while tables ranged up to $100,000.\r\n",
      "Even though Cooper was being honored, he heaped praise on Penn and his nonprofit.\r\n",
      "\"Sean came with supplies, he stayed long after most of us had moved on,\" Cooper added. \"Sean stayed, listened and he learned. JP HRO became an organization born of disaster, but which is focused on addressing the poverty that existed there for far too long.\"\r\n",
      "Julia Roberts paid homage to Cooper before presenting him with the award. She said he showed bravery as a journalist in matters of crisis, as the event focused on his efforts after the earthquake left thousands of Haitians homeless and without basic resources almost a decade ago.\r\n",
      "\"His work was just not limited in journalism,\" Roberts said. \"In Haiti, he was a humanitarian and often first responder, a pioneer in a time of extreme uncertainty. Anderson Cooper is a good man, a brave man. He gives an honest portrayal.\"\r\n",
      "Penn followed suit acknowledging Cooper's \"aggressiveness to tell the truth in reporting the news.\" The actor has hosted the fundraiser for J/P HRO on the eve of the Golden Globes since he established the charity in 2010.\r\n",
      "During Saturday's event, Penn unveiled the name change of his Haitian Relief Organization to the Community Organized Relief Effort (CORE) in an effort to rebrand his nonprofit. He wants his charity to expand its efforts from Haiti to more areas in the United States.\r\n",
      "Penn said he wants to strengthen communities in crisis by helping them \"recover swiftly in the face of emergency.\" In a video, he showed volunteers helping repair some damage to homes in Savannah, Georgia, after the powerful Hurricane Florence thrashed the coastal area last year.\r\n",
      "Larry David, Casey Affleck, Sarah Silverman, Jimmy Kimmel, Ben Stiller and Garcelle Beauvais were among the guests at the gala dinner. Musical performances were by Macy Gray, Billie Eilish and Linda Perry.\r\n",
      "The event honored San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz and ambassador Kenneth Merten. The Point Dume Bombers, who stayed up all night to help save their Malibu neighborhood from the fast-moving wildfires that scorched the area displacing thousands from their California homes, were also recognized.\r\n",
      "Jamie Foxx provided the comedy relief as the event's master of ceremony. He jokingly took selfies during Penn's speech, but also stood beside the auctioneer to urge attendees to raise their bids.\r\n",

      "Title:  303 At FEMA office, federal workers say they're here to help\n",
      "Content:  303 EAGLE RIVER, Alaska (AP) At a small office in an Eagle River church, nearly a dozen federal employees are working to both mitigate problems and manage expectations of those seeking help after the Nov. 30, 2018 earthquake.\r\n",
      "They're the government, and they're here to help.\r\n",
      "\"We're here as long as we're needed,\" said Jack Heesch, an external affairs officer for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\r\n",
      "Heesch two other federal employees sat down for an interview Friday at Community Covenant Church, where employees from across the country are working to guide people through the often complicated and sometimes frustrating process of applying for federal disaster assistance. Center manager Miriam Zayas said the purpose of the center is to provide people with face-to-face answers about how they can receive help.\r\n",
      "\"We make sure they leave here and they really understand everything,\" Zayas said. \"Sometimes they are overwhelmed because it's a lot of information.\"\r\n",
      "FEMA operates four disaster recovery centers in the area, with two in Anchorage and another in Wasilla. Each of the centers has been seeing about 30-35 people each day, with more than 436 visiting the Eagle River center since it opened in mid February.\r\n",
      "The first step in the federal aid process is to apply, Zayas said. That can be done either online at disasterassistance.gov or in person. Applicants who apply in person should make sure they have their Social Security number, address, a description of damages, insurance information, a phone number, a bank account and routing number and an address where they can receive mail.\r\n",
      "Once someone has applied, they need to have an inspection done showing any damage to the home and a contractor's estimate of what repairs are needed. After that, FEMA claims workers will review the claim and make a determination on how much money someone will receive. If someone has homeowner's insurance, the claim may be initially denied until the homeowner shows they don't have an earthquake rider on their policy, Zayas said.\r\n",
      "Managing people's expectations about how much money they'll receive is one of the workers' biggest challenges. Although the maximum amount of federal grant aid a homeowner can receive is $34,900, Heesch said it's \"rare\" for anyone to receive the full amount.\r\n",
      "\"You have to lose the whole house,\" he said. \"And the problem we find is when that word gets out, that $34,900, it sets a really false expectation.\"\r\n",
      "Heesch said in recent disasters such as hurricanes, the average grant ended up being about $5,000. As of last Friday, Heesch said the agency had so far dispersed about $3.4 million to 1,377 Alaskans since a federal disaster was declared at the end of January an average of about $2,500 to each recipient.\r\n",
      "The reason for the disparity, Heesch said, is that FEMA is only going to provide enough aid to return people to \"a safe, secure, sanitary, habitable dwelling.\"\r\n",
      "\"A safe house is one where the doors and windows lock. A sanitary house is one that has running water. A habitable house is one in which you can live safely and securely,\" he said.\r\n",
      "That means FEMA may be able to provide money for temporary housing or a new refrigerator, but the government may not pay for home repairs that aren't deemed critical to safety and habitability. People who are unhappy with the amount of federal aid they receive can file an appeal within 60 days.\r\n",
      "\"You will have to include contractor's estimate that specifies that those damages were caused by the disaster, with a letter stating why you need more help,\" Zayas said.\r\n",
      "There are also state grants available, though the deadline to apply for those has already passed.\r\n",
      "For folks who need more assistance than the state or FEMA can provide with grants, there are other options. The U.S. Small Business Administration has employees in Eagle River to help people apply for low-cost federal loans. Loans are available for up to homeowners for up to $200,000 for home repairs plus $40,000 for personal property (for which renters are also eligible). SBA public information officer Bill Koontz said it's free to apply for the 2 percent loans, there is no obligation and loans can be paid back over 30 years.\r\n",
      "\"This whole arrangement is geared so that people get immediate help from FEMA cash in their hands for what they absolutely need but long-term help is going to be in the form of a loan,\" Koontz said. \"And by the government doing it that way that money that SBA loans out comes back into the government's hands and is loaned out in other disasters, which allows there to be more disaster assistance throughout the country.\"\r\n",
      "Staff at the disaster recovery center will also provide people with information about how to mitigate existing and future damage as well as other resources available for those in need everything from food pantries to mental health counseling.\r\n",
      "Although the government can't return life to normal for people, Zayas said the job of guiding them through the process is rewarding.\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes, I love it,\" said the Puerto Rico native, who said she's worked in disaster recovery centers everywhere from Coney Island to the Louisiana bayou.\r\n",
      "Heesch said the workers at the disaster recovery center know they can't solve every problem for people, but they will provide a human voice to answer questions.\r\n",
      "\"Their mentality, their demeanor is that of somebody who is a social worker,\" he said. \"Because that's their job is to help people recover. And they're trying to find ways to make that happen.\"\r\n",
      "However, Zayas said she's ready for spring.\r\n",
      "\"It's too cold!\"\r\n",
      "The disaster recovery center at Community Covenant Church (16123 Artillery Road) is open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. The SBA also has an office set up in the Eagle River Town Center building to aid business owners impacted by the quake. The SBA office is open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday.\r\n",

      "Content:  304 SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) A 6.7-magnitude earthquake shook cities and towns on Chile's northern coast late Saturday, but there were no immediate reports of damages.\r\n",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake's epicenter was 15.6 kilometers (9.7 miles) south-southwest of Coquimbo, and it had a depth of 53 kilometers. It struck at 10:32 p.m. local time.\r\n",
      "Chile's National Emergency Office preventatively ordered the evacuation of a stretch of coast near the city of Coquimbo but later called it off.\r\n",
      "Authorities said the quake didn't have the characteristics that would generate a tsunami. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also discarded a tsunami threat.\r\n",
      "The quake was felt strongly in northern Chile where buildings swayed, according to social media and press reports.\r\n",
      "Chile's seismological service put the strength of the quake at magnitude 6.8.\r\n",
      "Chile is located in the so-called \"Ring of Fire,\" which makes it one of the most seismic countries in the world. An 8.8-magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami in 2010 killed 525 people and left 26 missing.\r\n",

      "Title:  305 Preparing for the Cascadia quake, 1 shopping trip at a time\n",
      "Content:  305 EUGENE, Ore. (AP) Don Metheny began preparing for the Cascadia earthquake seven years ago when he moved to Florence, the Lane County coastal town facing the double danger of a powerful quake and a devastating tsunami.\r\n",
      "He moved to Eugene a year later, but he hasn't stopped preparing for the earthquake that could wreak havoc on the southern Willamette Valley.\r\n",
      "A retired engineer and member of the Southeast Neighbors neighborhood association in Eugene, Metheny already has \"go-bags\" packed for himself and his wife, supplies and water stashed around his home, and more emergency items loaded into the spare-tire compartment of his car. His go-bag is on wheels so he won't have to lug a backpack around after the quake.\r\n",
      "\"To me it is a matter of spreading it around so something will survive and you can get to it,\" he said.\r\n",
      "If the earthquake levels his home or crushes his car, he's hoping he'll still have emergency supplies at the ready. He even has some gear secured outside in an effort to increase his odds.\r\n",
      "Scientists expect the Cascadia subduction zone off the Oregon Coast to produce a massive magnitude 9.0 earthquake, potentially in the near future. The quake will disrupt life throughout Oregon, and help from local, state and federal agencies likely won't be immediate.\r\n",
      "State of Oregon emergency managers used to advise Oregonians to be ready to go three days on their own in the case of the Cascadia quake or other major disaster. In recent years that warning stretched to two weeks. Preparing to be self reliant for 14 full days may seem overwhelming and expensive. But, Metheny and others with experience say it can be done.\r\n",
      "They recommend buying emergency supplies a little at a time, starting with the essentials (water, food and shelter) and then deciding where to store the items. Truly being two weeks ready requires planning, preparing and reviewing. It's an ongoing effort rather than a one-day or weekend chore.\r\n",
      "Shopping list: Three months to being ready\r\n",
      "Preparing emergency supplies for the Cascadia earthquake can be overwhelming and expensive if attempted all at once. So experts recommend breaking up the purchases. The city of Eugene offers this list, to be checked off over three months.\r\n",
      "For more useful information, go to oregon.gov/oem/hazardsprep/Pages/2-Weeks-Ready.aspx and eugene-or.gov/382/Community-Emergency-Response-Team-CERT.\r\n",
      "\"You can get there over time,\" said Cory Grogan, spokesman for the Oregon Office of Emergency Management in Salem. \"You don't have to do it all at once.\"\r\n",
      "And the supplies will be useful not just for earthquakes. Ice storms, wildfire and other disasters could all leave people in Lane County on their own, relying on themselves, their emergency supplies and neighbors for a couple of weeks.\r\n",
      "A little becomes a lot\r\n",
      "An emergency cache starts with one item. It slowly grows from there.\r\n",
      "\"Take your time,\" Metheny said. \"Save a little bit extra each week. When you go to the grocery store, buy one extra bottle of water. One extra can of food. And just accumulate it over time.\"\r\n",
      "Water tops the list of emergency supplies emphasized by officials. The general recommendation is one gallon of water, per person, per day. The amount accounts for water to drink and water to wash.\r\n",
      "In his garage, Metheny has a 55-gallon drum of water. He's added a powder to the water so it will be drinkable for five years. He has also tucked bottles of water in closets around his house, as well as under the kitchen sink. In all, Metheny estimates he has 100 gallons of water stored. That's more than double the 42 gallons experts recommend he should have on hand for his family. He and his wife have a dog, so they've stored water and food for their pet, too.\r\n",
      "But, Metheny also is thinking of his neighbors.\r\n",
      "\"Part of it is preparing for yourself and part of it is preparing for people who are going to need your help,\" he said. Metheny's stash also includes a water filter recommended to him by a chemist friend.\r\n",
      "Food is another essential, and it highlights how people will prepare differently to be self-reliant for half a month.\r\n",
      "The food should be nonperishable, either canned or dehydrated, and something pleasing to your palate.\r\n",
      "Kelsey Madsen and her partner, Christopher Sharpe, also have been stockpiling food to become two-weeks ready at their Eugene home. She's the administrator for Cascadia Prepared. The Eugene-based nonprofit advocates for better roads and bridges, power lines and communication systems all to brace for the earthquake.\r\n",
      "\"It's a lot of things we would buy normally,\" she said of the emergency food cache. \"We just bought them in larger amounts.\"\r\n",
      "The couple purchased much of the food in bulk. Using a vacuum sealer, they've stored up quinoa and dried fruit, among other foods they like to eat. That's important, she said.\r\n",
      "\"If you don't want to eat it normally, you're not going to want to eat it during a disaster,\" Madsen said.\r\n",
      "When it comes to food, it's also necessary to have a way to open it and a way to heat it up if the food requires cooking. (Dehydrated backpacking meals need boiled water.) Experts recommend having a can opener, camp stove and fuel, as well as a lighter or matches. They remind people not to use camp stoves indoors. The exhaust can be deadly.\r\n",
      "Shelter, or protection from the elements, is another essential. The earthquake may make homes unlivable, so having a tent and other camping gear available can be useful. But reliable rain gear, a warm sleeping bag and blankets are other forms of shelter. The earthquake could occur anytime of year, so it may leave Oregonians out in the cold and rain of winter or the heat of summer.\r\n",
      "Depending on the individual preparing the emergency supplies, medicines may also be essential and a must-have in emergency supplies.\r\n",
      "Metheny said he takes a blood pressure prescription medicine. Each time he picks up his prescription he collects some extra and then rotates it through his go-bag, so he's using the old medicine first and avoiding the pills expiring. It's a chore, but he says it will be worth it if he's having to be on his own for a couple weeks after the earthquake.\r\n",
      "Comfort in crisis\r\n",
      "The essentials form the foundation for a stockpile of emergency supplies. Then comes handy, but not necessary, items, followed by items purely for comfort after the quake.\r\n",
      "Handy items might include aluminum foil for cooking and tarps to help keep things dry or out of the sun. Comfort items might include coffee and a deck of playing cards.\r\n",
      "\"Once you have those really basic things that you need to ensure that you can stay alive, then you look at the things that you need to be able to help your family recover or to be able to sustain themselves for a longer amount of time,\" said Ken Vogeney, emergency manager for the city of Springfield.\r\n",
      "Experts often advise people to keep at least a half a tank of gas in their car or truck. The earthquake will likely make fuel supplies scarce. Madsen extends the notion to other items that she wouldn't want to be caught without for a couple of weeks, chiefly toilet paper and toothpaste.\r\n",
      "Carlos Barrera, a board member of the Friendly Area Neighbors neighborhood association, and others deep in the process of preparing for the Cascadia earthquake also mention another small but simple step to be ready. He recommends that people place some sturdy shoes under their bed. If the earthquake hits at night, they might awake to a home turned into an obstacle course of shattered glass and debris.\r\n",
      "\"There's going to be a lot of broken glass because of all that shaking,\" he said. \"It's going to be breaking windows, causing dishes and everything to fall out of cabinets. Pictures are going to fall off the wall. Your TV may fly across the room.\"\r\n",
      "Barrera added that work gloves and a hard hat would also be good emergency items to have at the ready, by the bed.\r\n",
      "Prepare now, ready later\r\n",
      "Firefighters, medics and police officers will be swamped after the Cascadia earthquake. They'll be busy responding to priority fires, medical emergencies and conducting search and rescues in collapsed buildings. Damaged bridges and roads also will delay response.\r\n",
      "So, any emergency supplies prepared now will be invaluable after the quake.\r\n",
      "\"The reality is that in a disaster as large as we expect Cascadia could be, we are our own first responders in this community and we need to be prepared at an individual level to take care of ourselves, our families and our neighbors until help can arrive,\" said Lane County spokeswoman Devon Ashbridge.\r\n",
      "County and city emergency managers have encouraged neighborhood associations, businesses and other groups to help people prepare together for the earthquake and other potential disasters.\r\n",
      "Knowing now who in the neighborhood is a doctor or nurse, or who has a two-way radio setup, will be valuable after the earthquake.\r\n",
      "\"Some (of your neighbors) may have skills that will be useful, some of them may have tools or equipment that may be useful during a disaster,\" Barrera said. \"So people really need to organize and take care of each other during that period of time when emergency services aren't going to be available.\"\r\n",

      "Content:  306 TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s economy bounced back in the fourth quarter as business and consumer spending recovered from the impact of natural disasters but trade frictions and a proposed sales tax hike are expected to hinder growth in 2019. \r\n",
      "The 1.4 percent annualised expansion in October-December matched the median estimate in a Reuters poll. It also followed an upwardly revised 2.6 percent annualised contraction in July-September as floods and an earthquake temporarily halted production. \r\n",
      "Real exports rose 0.9 percent in October-December from the previous quarter, the data from the Cabinet Office showed, the fastest growth in a year. \r\n",
      "Despite the increase in shipments, economists remain concerned that exports will weaken this year if the United States and China do not resolve their trade dispute. \r\n",
      "“The numbers have rebounded, but Japan is still an economy that is losing momentum,” said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. \r\n",
      "“The longer trade friction lasts, the more incentive Japanese companies have to halt capex. Trade friction means weaker exports. Japan’s overall growth this year won’t be as quick as last year or the year prior.” \r\n",
      "GDP rose 0.3 percent versus the previous quarter, slightly less than the median estimate for 0.4 percent growth. That followed a downwardly revised 0.7 percent contraction in July-September. \r\n",
      "In September a large earthquake triggered a blackout in the northern island of Hokkaido, which followed severe typhoons that damaged airports and transport infrastructure in western Japan. \r\n",
      "Businesses were quick to resume normal operations after these disasters. \r\n",
      "Capital expenditure was the biggest driver of growth in October-December, rising 2.4 percent as companies spent on manufacturing equipment and heavy construction machinery. \r\n",
      "That compares with as 2.7 percent contraction in the previous quarter, a smaller fall than initially estimated. Capital expenditure was expected to rise 1.8 percent. \r\n",
      "Private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of GDP, was the second-biggest driver of growth. Consumption rose 0.6 percent in October-December, less than the 0.8 percent increase expected and followed a 0.2 decline in the previous quarter. \r\n",
      "Consumption was driven by spending on hotels and dining out, but that was partly a rebound from a decline in the previous quarter due to the natural disasters, a Cabinet Office official said. \r\n",
      "“The economy is in gradual recovery as growth is led by private demand,” Japanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said in a statement. \r\n",
      "“China-bound exports of information-related materials have weakened as the Chinese economy slowed. We need to monitor uncertainty over global economic outlook including Chinese economy as well as fluctuations in financial markets.” \r\n",
      "External demand - or exports minus imports - shaved 0.3 percentage point off gross domestic product, less than the median estimate of minus 0.4 percent. A breakdown of the data showed a 2.7 percent jump in imports due to increased shipments of mobile phones and clothes from overseas more than offset the increase in exports. \r\n",
      "Despite the rise in exports, the trade war between the United States and China, the world’s two largest economies, is seen as a major risk for Japan’s exports of car parts, electronics, and heavy machinery to China, which are used to make finished goods destined for the United States and other markets. \r\n",
      "“We expect exports for January-March will deteriorate as shipments of IT-related products to Asian nations, especially to China, will likely fall as the adverse impact from trade conflict appears,” said Hiroaki Muto, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute. \r\n",
      "“The economy for January-March is expected to grow but the global economic slowdown and a planned sales tax hike will hurt.” \r\n",
      "Another risk is the Japanese government’s plan to raise the nationwide sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in October. \r\n",
      "The government needs the extra tax revenue to pay for rising welfare costs, but some policymakers and economists worry the tax hike could hit consumer spending and weaken sentiment. \r\n",

      "Content:  308 TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo Electric Power has begun removing spent nuclear fuel rods from a second building at the wrecked Fukushima plant, using remote-controlled cranes to lift hundreds of radioactive cylinders from a highly contaminated reactor site. \r\n",
      "The company, known as Tepco, said on Monday that it had successfully removed the first of more than 560 fuel rod assemblies by 0051 GMT from the No. 3 reactor and placed it in a specially designed steel cask for transfer to the ground. \r\n",
      "The reactor was one of three reactors at Fukushima that suffered meltdowns after a 2011 earthquake and tsunami shut down the plant’s cooling systems. \r\n",
      "In 2014, Tepco finished the removal fuel rods from the No. 4 reactor. However, the removal operation for the No. 3 site will be much more difficult because of the damage it suffered in the 2011 disaster, with an explosion covering the pool where the rods currently sit in debris, including a crane. \r\n",
      "The damage and debris removal delayed the No. 3 operations for four years. Additionally, the highly irradiated air around the site means all the cranes moving the transportation casks carrying the rods, which weigh abut 45 tonnes, must be operated remotely. \r\n",
      "Tepco must pluck the brittle and potentially damaged assemblies from a flooded compartment on the reactor site that is 18 metres (60 feet) above ground level and place them in containment casks, raise the casks from the pool and place them on a truck on the ground to transport them to a final pool of water for storage. \r\n",
      "If the rods are exposed to air or if they break, radioactive gases could be released into the atmosphere. \r\n",
      "“The work is expected to completed in March 2021, but safety is our first priority,” spokesman Joji Hara told Reuters. \r\n",
      "The 2011 disaster forced 160,000 people to evacuate areas nearby the Fukushima plant, and many of them have never returned to the most contaminated areas. \r\n",
      "Japan’s government estimated in 2016 that the total cost of dismantling Fukushima, decontaminating the affected areas, and paying compensation would amount to 21.5 trillion yen ($192 billion), around 20 percent of the country’s annual budget. \r\n",
      "Even with the successful transfer of the fuel rods, Tepco faces other problems at Fukushima. \r\n",
      "Tepco has struggled for more than eight years with rising levels of contaminated water that comes from its jerry-rigged cooling system for the melted reactor cores, in addition to power failures and water leaks. Last year, Tepco said a system meant to purify contaminated water had failed to remove dangerous radioactive contaminants, setting back efforts to deal with the water that is piling up in tanks covering the site. \r\n",

      "Content:  309 Feb. 11, 2019, 11:33 PM GMT\r\n",
      "By Kerry Sanders and Erika Angulo\r\n",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela Millions of students are mobilizing to take to the streets of Venezuela on Tuesday during Youth Day.\r\n",
      "The day commemorates the young people who fought and died in the Battle of La Victoria in 1814 during Venezuela's war for independence, and touts the role that youth play in the country's economic and social future.\r\n",
      "Venezuelan students such as Anna Ferreira, 22, are using Youth Day as a way to protest the country's government and the current political turmoil.\r\n",
      "We want a better future and the only way we can see that is to stop the regime of President Nicolás Maduro. This year we are closer than ever to get that, Ferreira, a student at a liberal arts college, told NBC News on Monday.\r\n",
      "Students such as Ferreira believe that Juan Guaidó, who declared himself interim president last month, will deliver on his promise to reinstate democratically held elections. The country's hyperinflation, severe food and medicine shortages, and instability have sent more than 3 million Venezuelans fleeing to other countries.\r\n",
      "Ferreira was born just prior to the socialist revolution in 1999, meaning that socialism is the only government system shes ever known. However, her parents have memories of a different Venezuela under a capitalist economy.\r\n",
      "I hear the stories of the childhood of my parents, the childhood of my grandmother and we want that, we are living with an ideal in our heads of something we believe is possible and we want to accomplish, she said.\r\n",
      "Maduro supporters, on the other hand, admit the system they believe in may have flaws including monthly food rations and supply shortages but they still support a government that began when their hero Hugo Chavez came to power.\r\n",
      "At a government-sponsored rally, one Maduro supporter in his 70s, who would not give his name, said that Guiadó is nothing more than a clown.\r\n",
      "On Monday, Maduro invited the international media to see the launch of a new marketing campaign to promote investment and tourism in the country.\r\n",
      "\"There isnt another country with better investment opportunities, he said as he stood on a stage in front of a giant screen that had played a high definition video showing the country's natural beauty.\r\n",

      "Content:  311 March 27, 2019, 3:25 PM GMT\r\n",
      "By Nicole Acevedo and Associated Press\r\n",
      "WASHINGTON President Donald Trump once again voiced his opposition around disaster aid funding for Puerto Rico, complicating matters in Congress ahead of a vote on a disaster aid package.\r\n",
      "Trump told Republican legislators at a Capitol Hill meeting on Tuesday that the U.S. territory has gotten too much rebuilding money compared with mainland states like Florida and Texas.\r\n",
      "According to Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Trump told Republicans during a closed-door luncheon that aid for Puerto Rico is way out of proportion to what Texas and Florida and others have gotten.\r\n",
      "Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló labeled the comments as irresponsible, regrettable and, above all, unjustified and described Trump as someone who lacks empathy.\r\n",
      "The comments attributed to Donald Trump today by senators from his own party are below the dignity of a sitting President of the United States, said Rosselló in a statement Wednesday.\r\n",
      "Trumps opposition to additional Puerto Rico funding sets up a showdown with House Democrats, who insist that a $13 billion to $14 billion disaster aid package that is a priority for Republican legislators from southern states wont advance without further aid for the island.\r\n",
      "Ahead of the Senate vote on the disaster aid package, which is expected to pass this week, Minority leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Senate Appropriations Chairman Patrick Leahy blasted Trump and his administration for continuing to undermine the immediate and long-term recovery efforts in Puerto Rico.\r\n",
      "In a letter Schumer and Leahy sent to Mick Mulvaney, acting chief of staff at the Office of Management and Budget Director; Peter Gaynor, acting FEMA Administrator; and HUD secretary Ben Carson, both senators expressed concerns over the significant and unsupported delays related to the immediate and long-term recovery needs of Puerto Rico in the aftermath of catastrophic Hurricanes Irma and Maria as billions of dollars approved by Congress a year and a half ago remain in the U.S. Treasury in Washington and have not made their way to the Puerto Rican people.\r\n",
      "House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., said the House will insist on further aid for Puerto Rico or the disaster aid measure wont clear Congress.\r\n",
      "The measure has wide support from both Democrats and Republicans and is backed by David Perdue, R-Ga., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., whose states were slammed by hurricanes last fall. The measure has been expanded so that Midwestern states such as Iowa and Nebraska that are currently suffering from flooding are eligible for disaster help.\r\n",
      "Just at the time when harvesting was starting, Hurricane Michael hit and crops were completely destroyed across most of our state, Perdue said.\r\n",
      "The House passed a companion $14.2 billion version of the legislation in January, but it got tangled up in the politics of the partial government shutdown and Trumps demands for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\r\n",
      "The measure is especially sought by lawmakers from Southern states like Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, which were hit by hurricanes Michael and Florence last year. Theres money to respond to an earthquake in Alaska, wildfires in California and floods in South Carolina and for the ongoing recovery effort in Puerto Rico, which was devastated by back-to-back hurricanes in 2017.\r\n",
      "Puerto Ricos decade-long recession has left the island unable to fully fund its own reconstruction and recovery process. However, accomplishing this has turned out to be more difficult than expected amid threats from the president to cut funding for Puerto Rico.\r\n",
      "Earlier this year, the Trump administration publicly opposed that Puerto Rico receive $600 million to finance food stamp shortfalls, calling it excessive and unnecessary and considered using $2.5 billion assigned for reconstruction projects in the island to pay for a U.S.-Mexico border wall.\r\n",
      " According to Rubio, Trump supports the food stamp funding but opposes more generous terms for delivery of disaster aid dollars and funding to rebuild antiquated water systems and make them more resilient to future storms.\r\n",
      "For over a year, Trump and his administration have been criticized over their response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.\r\n",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the storm, over 200,000 Puerto Ricans left for the mainland some temporarily and Puerto Rico incurred about $90 billion in damages.\r\n",
      "When Trump first visited the disaster area in Oct. 2017, he said that Puerto Rico was not a real catastrophe\" like Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.\r\n",
      "Months later, a study commissioned by the Puerto Rican government revealed that at least 2,975 people died in Puerto Rico from the effects of Hurricane Maria including a lack of electricity, impassable roads and a scarcity of medications and other provisions making it the deadliest natural disaster in the U.S. in 100 years.\r\n",
      "Trump has not yet publicly acknowledged or mourned the victims of the catastrophe following the revised figures.\r\n",
      "Federal government offices such as FEMA acknowledged agency failures in areas such as staffing and coordination in an after-action report, while agencies like HUD allocated historic amounts of funding for the island in the area of housing, infrastructure and energy but most of the money has not made its way to communities in need.\r\n",

      "Jeff Estes has worked as a federal contractor for 35 years in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Now he and his colleagues are out of work because of a partial government shutdown that as of Saturday became the longest in American history.\r\n",
      "For Estes, a union official and electrician, the shutdown is becoming particularly burdensome because hes paying for his two kids to attend college, and the governments recent decision to change contractors forced him and his coworkers to reapply for their jobs.\r\n",
      "With much of the government at a standstill, Estes and his colleagues members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers aren't sure whether they will still have a job when it's over, he said. Those in a position to know are furloughed, leaving Estes and many others more than frustrated as the government shutdown enters its 22nd day on Saturday.\r\n",
      "Its not a D problem. Its not an R problem. Its Washington, D.C., the Beltway, Estes told NBC News. People in America and the workforce should not be used as pawns. Deal with your business without putting me out of the job. Do your job, and Ill keep doing mine.\r\n",
      "Approximately 800,000 federal employees are estimated to be furloughed or working without pay because President Donald Trump and Congress cannot reach a deal to reopen the government. They are at an impasse over $5.7 billion for construction of a wall along the southern border.\r\n",
      "The number of furloughed employees does not include federal contractors like Estes. Its unclear how many contract or grant employees are affected by the shutdown or even how many there are in total but a Volcker Alliance report estimated that nearly 5.3 million worked as contractors in 2015.\r\n",
      "Unlike furloughed federal employees, who have received assurances that they will be paid once the shutdown ends, contractors are not owed back pay. That has left them in an even murkier economic position.\r\n",
      "Most Americans cannot afford to miss a paycheck, said Joseph Stiglitz, an economics professor at Columbia University whose work relating to inequality earned him the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.\r\n",
      "While everyone tends to have a house, car, health insurance and car payment to make, the person they owe money to arent inclined to be particularly forgiving or account for a government shutdown, Stiglitz said.\r\n",
      "Its an inequality issue in that it affects people at the bottom, Stiglitz said. And it hits them really strongly because in America, so many have experienced such high levels of inequality that a large fraction of Americans have no substantial cash reserves. They depend on that paycheck coming in every month.\r\n",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she knows the shutdown is having a significant impact on her state, telling NBC News that she has spoken to a number of constituents since the shutdown took effect.\r\n",
      "Hundreds of federal workers and contractors rally against the partial federal government shutdown Thursday outside the headquarters of the AFL-CIO in Washington.Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images\r\n",
      "Her state is feeling the economic pain from the ongoing political fight more than most. Alaska has the most federal workers affected per capita than any other state, and nearly half the federal workers there work for agencies without appropriations.\r\n",
      "They're the ones who are trying to knit this all together, that are trying to figure out, OK, we've got earthquake damage that we're dealing with and it's costing us more than we thought it was going to, Murkowski said. It's cold. It's four below in Fairbanks, where I went to high school, this morning. You don't think that jacks up people's home heating like sky high?\r\n",
      "That could be a reason for economic concern beyond just the individual household, particularly in small communities where businesses are dependent on those individuals spending their paychecks.\r\n",
      "When individuals are living as close to the edge as such a large fraction of Americans are living, these are the kinds of events that can precipitate a downward spiral, Stiglitz said.\r\n",
      "The shutdown isnt affecting only labor, either.\r\n",
      "And as the shutdown continues further without a clear potential conclusion after the president threatened to keep the government closed for months or even years, experts say the economic ripple effects could heavily impact the entire nation.\r\n",
      "Jason Furman, professor of the practice of economic policy at Harvard Kennedy School and the most recent chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, said the nation is entering increasingly uncharted territory.\r\n",
      "The impact really depends heavily on how the highly ambiguous rules are interpreted and implemented by the administration, for example the decisions around SNAP and refund checks matter a lot, Furman said in an email. Overall, however, we know that the costs of the shutdown grow non-linearly with time as agencies run out of ways to get around it. So expect them [agency costs] to grow.\r\n",
      "Its the uncertainty that leaves a lot of experts worried about the economic impact that a prolonged shutdown could have, especially during a period of global market uncertainty.\r\n",
      "Currently the country faces a trade war, stock market uncertainty, an economic slowdown in China and an economic slowdown in Europe two key trading partners.\r\n",
      "No time is a good time, but this is a particularly bad time because the nature of uncertainty is that it compounds exponentially, Stiglitz said.\r\n",
      "Were talking about $5.7 billion for a wall, the economist added, but the costs that are inflicted on the economy are orders of magnitude beyond that $5.7 billion.\r\n",

      "WASHINGTON The nuclear power industry is pushing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to cut back on inspections at nuclear power plants and throttle back what it tells the public about plant problems. The agency, whose board is dominated by Trump appointees, is listening.\r\n",
      "Commission staffers are weighing some of the industry's requests as part of a sweeping review of how the agency enforces regulations governing the country's 98 commercially operating nuclear plants. Recommendations are due to the five-member NRC board in June.\r\n",
      "Annie Caputo, a former nuclear-energy lobbyist now serving as one of four board members appointed or reappointed by President Donald Trump, told an industry meeting this week that she was \"open to self-assessments\" by nuclear plant operators, who are proposing that self-reporting by operators take the place of some NRC inspections.\r\n",
      "The Trump NRC appointees and industry representatives say changes in oversight are warranted to reflect the industry's overall improved safety records and its financial difficulties, as the operating costs of the country's aging nuclear plants increase and affordable natural gas and solar and wind power gain in the energy market.\r\n",
      "But the prospect of the Trump administration's regulation-cutting mission reaching the NRC alarms some independent industry watchdogs, who say the words \"nuclear safety\" and \"deregulation\" don't go together.\r\n",
      "For example, \"the deregulatory agenda at SEC is a significant concern as well, but it's not a nuclear power plant,\" said Geoffrey Fettus, a senior attorney for nuclear issues at the Natural Resources Defense Council, referring to the federal government's Securities Exchange Commission.\r\n",
      "\"For an industry that is increasingly under financial decline ... to take regulatory authority away from the NRC puts us on a collision course,\" said Paul Gunter, of the anti-nuclear group Beyond Nuclear. With what? \"With a nuclear accident,\" Gunter said.\r\n",
      "The industry made its requests for change in a letter delivered by the Nuclear Energy Institute group. A \"high-priority\" ask is to eliminate press releases about lower-level safety issues at plants meaning the kind of problems that could trigger more inspections and oversight at a plant but not constitute an emergency.\r\n",
      "The industry group also asked that the NRC reduce the \"burden of radiation-protection and emergency-preparedness inspections.\"\r\n",
      "Nuclear plant operators amplified their requests at an annual meeting in the Washington, D.C, area this week.\r\n",
      "Scaling back disclosure of lower-level problems at plants is \"more responsible ... than to put out a headline on the webpage to the world,\" said Greg Halnon, vice president of regulatory affairs for Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp., which says its fleet of nuclear and other power plants supplies 6 million customers in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.\r\n",
      "When the NRC makes public the problems found at a plant, utilities get \"pretty rapid calls from the press, SEC filings get impacted because of potential financial impact,\" Halnon said.\r\n",
      "Requests by utilities for rate increases also can be affected, Halnon said.\r\n",
      "Trump has said he wants to help both the coal and nuclear power industries. So far, it's the more politically influential coal industry that's gotten significant action on the regulatory rollbacks that it sought from the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies.\r\n",
      "In January, Trump appointees to the NRC disappointed environmental groups by voting down a staff proposal that nuclear plants be required to substantially and expensively harden themselves against major floods and other natural disasters. The proposal was meant to be a main NRC response to the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster after Japan's 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in 2011.\r\n",
      "Caputo, who previously worked for nuclear plant operator Exelon Corp, told operators this week her aim was \"risk-informed decision-making,\" concentrating regulatory oversight on high-risk problems.\r\n",
      "\"We shouldn't regulate to zero risk,\" said David Wright, a former South Carolina public-utility commissioner appointed to the NRC board last year.\r\n",
      "\"The NRC mission is reasonable assurance of adequate protection no more, no less,\" Wright said.\r\n",
      "Tony Vegel, a Texas-based reactor safety official for the NRC, pushed back when industry executives publicly made their case for fewer NRC inspections.\r\n",
      "\"It's difficult to come across as an independent regulator and rely on self-assessment\" from plants, Vegel said.\r\n",
      "The current review, commissioned by the new NRC panel, was looking at the inspections issues and related ones, NRC spokesman Scott Burnell said. Commissioners will decide after receiving the staff recommendations whether to adopt any of them, Burnell said.\n",

      "Content:  314 March 12, 2019, 4:43 PM GMT\r\n",
      "House Democrats introduced a bill Tuesday to provide a path to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, and people with other types of temporary immigration protections.\r\n",
      "Although the H.R. 6 bill, also known as the Dream and Promise Act, was introduced by California Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, the legislation's co-authors include Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., as well as New York Reps. Nydia M. Velázquez and Yvette D. Clarke, among other lead bill sponsors.\r\n",
      "The announcement has given hope to people like Ana Argueta, 55, who has been living and working in the United States as a cleaning custodian for a decade under the federal program known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS.\r\n",
      "TPS is granted to countries ravaged by natural disasters or war and allows citizens of those countries to remain in the U.S. until the situation improves back home. In the past decades, previous administrations from both parties have renewed recipients' TPS status, but the Trump administration has said it would be ending TPS for a majority of recipients.\r\n",
      "Though courts have temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending TPS, families hope the Democrats' legislation, if passed, could give them a permanent solution once and for all.\r\n",
      "I think this is good, Argueta told NBC News in Spanish. Now, we have to trust that, yes, it will go through.\r\n",
      "Argueta, born in El Salvador, is one of approximately 325,000 people in the U.S. who have TPS status and could eventually become U.S. citizens if the new legislation is eventually passed. Salvadorans were eligible for TPS status in 2001 after an earthquake devastated the country.\r\n",
      "The bill also provides a citizenship pathway to thousands of Liberians who have been granted Deferred Enforced Departure, known as DED, which is not considered an immigration status but shields a designated population from deportation.\r\n",
      "I ask lawmakers to please keep us in their conscience, and that they give us immigration reform. It is time. We deserve it. Weve been contributing for a long time and weve been paying our taxes like everybody else, Argueta, who is also a member of the 32BJ SEIU workers union, said.\r\n",
      "Pelosi spoke during a press conference announcing the new legislation.\r\n",
      "We look forward to a strong bipartisan vote to pass this bill, she said.\r\n",
      "If passed, the bill will also bring protections to people like Jessica Garcia, who is one of about 800,000 Dreamers who have DACA status, which allows young undocumented immigrants like her who were brought to the U.S. as children to work and study without fear of deportation.\r\n",
      "This is bill is not about dreams, but about realities, said García, 21, who is also a member of CHIRLA, an advocacy group that works to defend the human and civil rights of immigrants and refugees. Im asking Congress to pass a permanent solution that would permanently protect people like me.\r\n",
      "According to Roybal-Allard, the bill would provide lawful permanent status to immigrants who were brought to the U.S. at age 17 or younger who are employed, in higher education or in the military. It would also give those who already are DACA recipients access to in-state college tuition, federal student aid and a pathway to citizenship. \r\n",
      "\"My experience as a young person of diverse background makes me a strong, passionate and determined U.S. citizen in waiting,\" said García, who considers herself \"as American as 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' but with a proud Oaxacan heritage.\r\n",
      "Veláquez agreed.\r\n",
      "She is an American in every sense but on paper, and today is the day that we're going to start reversing that, Velázquez said about García.\r\n",
      "Amid a round of applause, Hoyer closed out the press conference saying that \"as the majority leader, I am here to pledge that this bill is going to be on the floor.\"\r\n",

      "Title:  317 Anderson Cooper honored at Sean Penn's star-studded benefit\n",
      "Content:  317 LOS ANGELES (AP) When Anderson Cooper first met Sean Penn after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the CNN anchor was initially skeptical of the actor's intentions to help the recovery efforts in the ravaged country.\r\n",
      "In time, Penn won Cooper over.\r\n",
      "\"I'm not sure how Sean got to Port-au-Prince, Haiti. It certainly was not easy. I'm not sure how much of a plan he had when he got there. But he didn't just come by himself, he came with a team,\" Cooper said Saturday night in front of a star-studded crowd at Penn's ninth annual benefit for the J/P Haitian Relief Organization.\r\n",
      "The fundraiser raised $3.5 million at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. Some individual plates cost $10,000 at most, while tables ranged up to $100,000.\r\n",
      "Even though Cooper was being honored, he heaped praise on Penn and his nonprofit.\r\n",
      "\"Sean came with supplies, he stayed long after most of us had moved on,\" Cooper added. \"Sean stayed, listened and he learned. JP HRO became an organization born of disaster, but which is focused on addressing the poverty that existed there for far too long.\"\r\n",
      "Julia Roberts paid homage to Cooper before presenting him with the award. She said he showed bravery as a journalist in matters of crisis, as the event focused on his efforts after the earthquake left thousands of Haitians homeless and without basic resources almost a decade ago.\r\n",
      "\"His work was just not limited in journalism,\" Roberts said. \"In Haiti, he was a humanitarian and often first responder, a pioneer in a time of extreme uncertainty. Anderson Cooper is a good man, a brave man. He gives an honest portrayal.\"\r\n",
      "Penn followed suit acknowledging Cooper's \"aggressiveness to tell the truth in reporting the news.\" The actor has hosted the fundraiser for J/P HRO on the eve of the Golden Globes since he established the charity in 2010.\r\n",
      "During Saturday's event, Penn unveiled the name change of his Haitian Relief Organization to the Community Organized Relief Effort (CORE) in an effort to rebrand his nonprofit. He wants his charity to expand its efforts from Haiti to more areas in the United States.\r\n",
      "Penn said he wants to strengthen communities in crisis by helping them \"recover swiftly in the face of emergency.\" In a video, he showed volunteers helping repair some damage to homes in Savannah, Georgia, after the powerful Hurricane Florence thrashed the coastal area last year.\r\n",
      "Larry David, Casey Affleck, Sarah Silverman, Jimmy Kimmel, Ben Stiller and Garcelle Beauvais were among the guests at the gala dinner. Musical performances were by Macy Gray, Billie Eilish and Linda Perry.\r\n",
      "The event honored San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz and ambassador Kenneth Merten. The Point Dume Bombers, who stayed up all night to help save their Malibu neighborhood from the fast-moving wildfires that scorched the area displacing thousands from their California homes, were also recognized.\r\n",
      "Jamie Foxx provided the comedy relief as the event's master of ceremony. He jokingly took selfies during Penn's speech, but also stood beside the auctioneer to urge attendees to raise their bids.\r\n",
      "Foxx's efforts worked as Mike Myers and Keegan-Michael Key left their seats to accompany them onstage to encourage the audience to give more.\r\n",
      "The most expensive items auctioned off included an exclusive visit to Haiti with Sean Penn and Anderson; and a private dinner by Jose Andres and music performance from Yo-Yo Ma. Each went for $200,000.\r\n",
      "Foxx said Rep. Maxine Waters pledged $1 million, and singer Jason Derulo donated $750,000 to the organization.\r\n",

      "Content:  324 The nuclear power industry is pushing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to cut back on inspections at nuclear power plants and throttle back what it tells the public about plant problems. The agency, whose board is dominated by Trump appointees, is listening.\r\n",
      "Commission staffers are weighing some of the industry's requests as part of a sweeping review of how the agency enforces regulations governing the country's 98 commercially operating nuclear plants. Recommendations are due to the five-member NRC board in June.\r\n",
      "Annie Caputo, a former nuclear-energy lobbyist now serving as one of four board members appointed or reappointed by President Donald Trump, told an industry meeting this week that she was \"open to self-assessments\" by nuclear plant operators, who are proposing that self-reporting by operators take the place of some NRC inspections.\r\n",
      "The Trump NRC appointees and industry representatives say changes in oversight are warranted to reflect the industry's overall improved safety records and its financial difficulties, as the operating costs of the country's aging nuclear plants increase and affordable natural gas and solar and wind power gain in the energy market.\r\n",
      "But the prospect of the Trump administration's regulation-cutting mission reaching the NRC alarms some independent industry watchdogs, who say the words \"nuclear safety\" and \"deregulation\" don't go together.\r\n",
      "For example, \"the deregulatory agenda at SEC is a significant concern as well, but it's not a nuclear power plant,\" said Geoffrey Fettus, a senior attorney for nuclear issues at the Natural Resources Defense Council, referring to the federal government's Securities Exchange Commission.\r\n",
      "\"For an industry that is increasingly under financial decline ... to take regulatory authority away from the NRC puts us on a collision course,\" said Paul Gunter, of the anti-nuclear group Beyond Nuclear. With what? \"With a nuclear accident,\" Gunter said.\r\n",
      "The industry made its requests for change in a letter delivered by the Nuclear Energy Institute group. A \"high-priority\" ask is to eliminate press releases about lower-level safety issues at plants meaning the kind of problems that could trigger more inspections and oversight at a plant but not constitute an emergency.\r\n",
      "The industry group also asked that the NRC reduce the \"burden of radiation-protection and emergency-preparedness inspections.\"\r\n",
      "Nuclear plant operators amplified their requests at an annual meeting in the Washington, D.C, area this week.\r\n",
      "Scaling back disclosure of lower-level problems at plants is \"more responsible ... than to put out a headline on the webpage to the world,\" said Greg Halnon, vice president of regulatory affairs for Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp., which says its fleet of nuclear and other power plants supplies 6 million customers in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.\r\n",
      "When the NRC makes public the problems found at a plant, utilities get \"pretty rapid calls from the press, SEC filings get impacted because of potential financial impact,\" Halnon said.\r\n",
      "Requests by utilities for rate increases also can be affected, Halnon said.\r\n",
      "Trump has said he wants to help both the coal and nuclear power industries. So far, it's the more politically influential coal industry that's gotten significant action on the regulatory rollbacks that it sought from the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies.\r\n",
      "In January, Trump appointees to the NRC disappointed environmental groups by voting down a staff proposal that nuclear plants be required to substantially and expensively harden themselves against major floods and other natural disasters. The proposal was meant to be a main NRC response to the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster after Japan's 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in 2011.\r\n",
      "Caputo, who previously worked for nuclear plant operator Exelon Corp, told operators this week her aim was \"risk-informed decision-making,\" concentrating regulatory oversight on high-risk problems.\r\n",
      "\"We shouldn't regulate to zero risk,\" said David Wright, a former South Carolina public-utility commissioner appointed to the NRC board last year.\r\n",
      "\"The NRC mission is reasonable assurance of adequate protection no more, no less,\" Wright said.\r\n",
      "Tony Vegel, a Texas-based reactor safety official for the NRC, pushed back when industry executives publicly made their case for fewer NRC inspections.\r\n",
      "\"It's difficult to come across as an independent regulator and rely on self-assessment\" from plants, Vegel said.\r\n",
      "The current review, commissioned by the new NRC panel, was looking at the inspections issues and related ones, NRC spokesman Scott Burnell said. Commissioners will decide after receiving the staff recommendations whether to adopt any of them, Burnell said.\n",

      "Content:  326 Feb. 28, 2019, 5:25 PM GMT\r\n",
      "MIAMI After Hurricane Maria devastated and virtually paralyzed Puerto Rico in September 2017, local and federal officials were having trouble getting to entire towns and cities that had been plunged into darkness and cut off from highways and communication. Yet the restaurateur and celebrity chef José Andrés went to the island, organized 19,000 volunteers in 25 makeshift kitchens and served over 3.5 million meals through one of the hardest years in the island's history.\r\n",
      "Andrés tells that story in \"We Fed an Island: The True Story of Rebuilding Puerto Rico, One Meal at a Time,\" a book released by the late Anthony Bourdains Ecco imprint last fall. While the book focuses on Puerto Rico, it's also a blueprint for how relief organizations can respond to both human-made and natural disasters.\r\n",
      "We cover blind spots. We bring leadership where sometimes leadership is totally gone, Andrés told NBC News last week at the renowned South Beach Wine and Food Festival in Miami. At the star-studded event, he gathered many of the island's chefs who worked with him after the hurricane, cooking up traditional dishes such as roast pork and boosting the U.S. territory he's come to know so well.\r\n",
      "In part, we celebrate that they are really heroes and in part were celebrating that Puerto Rico is open for business, that it has great food, great gastronomy, great places for travel Andrés said.\r\n",
      "The work of Andrés and his nonprofit, World Central Kitchen, has become synonymous with relief efforts around the world. Founded in 2010, the organization works with communities through health, education and culinary training, and provides much-needed meals and provisions. Beyond that, it's a vehicle to help areas ravaged by disaster move forward.\r\n",
      "Born in Spain, Andrés remains invested in Puerto Rico's recovery; this month World Central Kitchen announced it would commit $4 million to its Plow to Plate initiative, aimed at increasing the islands food security and sustainability by supporting farmers and local food businesses. The celebrity chef is confident the strength and resiliency he experienced firsthand on the island will help Puerto Ricans lift themselves from the storm's aftermath amid a historic fiscal crisis.\r\n",
      "Puerto Ricans, he said, \"demonstrated an impressive solidarity, an incredible generosity, patience, help to their neighbors.\r\n",
      "\"Another community couldnt have gone through those weeks and months after Maria in the form they did,\" he said. \"People who were aggrieved and indignant did it calmly, dignified and proudly at the same time. I think thats worthy of admiration.\r\n",
      "In the last year, World Central Kitchen has responded to events as far flung as a volcano in Guatemala, an earthquake in Indonesia and multiple tsunamis. Closer to home, they provided free meals to first responders during the California wildfires and to furloughed federal employees in Washington during the recent government shutdown.\r\n",
      "They are currently monitoring the situation in Venezuela, where his team delivered food to Cúcuta, on the border with Colombia.\r\n",
      "His efforts are being internationally recognized; he has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, which comes on top of being named twice to Times 100 Most Influential People list and chosen as the James Beard Foundation's Humanitarian of the Year.\r\n",
      "Andrés is still expanding his culinary empire, which includes Washingtons Michelin-starred minibar by José Andrés and concepts in Las Vegas, Beverly Hills and Mexico City. His restaurant group is scheduled to open Mercado Little Spain in New York City and Jaleo in Disney World in Florida this year.\r\n",
      "Chef Jose Andres attends the MasterCard Exclusive - Paella &amp;amp; Tapas by the Pool hosted by Jose Andres at 2016 Food Network &amp;amp; Cooking Channel South Beach Wine &amp;amp; Food Festival Presented By FOOD &amp;amp; WINE at SLS South Beach in Miami, Florida on February 25, 2016.John Parra / Getty Images for SOBEWFFAE file\r\n",
      "Despite this, Andrés shows now sign of sidelining his humanitarian work.\r\n",
      "If we dont answer to anything the rest of our lives, already World Central Kitchen did their tiny contribution in the few places weve been in the last few years helping. But the truth is, thats not our intention,\" he said. \"We feel theres a role for us to play, that we occupy, and that we can do very smart, very strategic, very quick and very effective. If anything, we are trying to have bigger and bigger capabilities to respond in more communities.\r\n",
      "He's perpetually aware of what's happening around him. At the festival, after making the rounds of the food stalls and gamely smiling through an onslaught of selfies, Andrés stationed himself at his vegetable oil-driven food truck parked just outside a hotel.\r\n",
      "While greeting friends and chatting to staff, Andrés quickly spotted a disabled homeless person struggling to get through the tourist traffic on Collins Avenue. Andrés motioned to his staff for water and food then delivered it to the man personally, a human exchange barely noticed by the sea of people passing by.\r\n",

      "Gabriel Jabri Fordham, 28, the man suspected of plowing into LaDerihanna and leaving her friend with lesser injuries before running away from the scene was arrested Tuesday. A passenger can also be seen on the surveillance video running from the crash, but police have not said if that person will be charged.\r\n",
      "Fordham is being held without bail on charges of serious injury by vehicle, failure to maintain a lane, failure to stop at a stop sign, reckless driving and hit-and-run, according to the DeKalb Sheriff's Office.

      "But in Washington, Tim Kilcoyne, a lead chef with the non-profit, set up a cafe and restaurant to feed federal workers that are fully furnished and already suited with a kitchen, not to mention surrounded by bustling businesses and busy streets. Here, the problem is not a fire or a flood -- they've arrived to help some of the 800,000 government employees who are still without a paycheck on day 26 of the longest-ever government shutdown.\r\n",
      "Whether its activation for a natural disaster or a human disaster were here to support, here to help, Kilcoyne said.\r\n",

      "Content:  329 When experts ponder the future of automobiles, they tend to focus on two novel modes of transportation: driverless cars and flying cars.\r\n",
      "At this years CES technology show in Las Vegas, Hyundai has introduced a third vision for how vehicles might traverse the world around them one that doesnt rely solely on wheels.\r\n",
      "More than 2,000 years after the wheelbarrows debut in classical Greece, ushering in a new era of locomotion, Hyundais latest concept car is designed to walk as easily as it rolls. Called Elevate, the daddy-long-legs-like machine has wheels at the end of long robotic legs that would allow users to drive, walk or even climb over the most treacherous terrain, according to the company.\r\n",
      "The company which labels the machine a UMV, or ultimate mobility vehicle said the concept was inspired by the need for resilient transportation in disaster zones, where conventional vehicles are often rendered useless.\r\n",
      "When a tsunami or earthquake hits, current rescue vehicles can only deliver first responders to the edge of the debris field, John Suh, Hyundai vice president and head of Hyundai CRADLE, said in a statement on the companys website. They have to go the rest of the way by foot. Elevate can drive to the scene and climb right over flood debris or crumbled concrete. \r\n",
      "[A new fleet of autonomous robots is now making one of the worlds oldest foods]\r\n",
      "Suh added that the vehicles usefulness wouldnt be limited to emergency situations. For people living with disabilities without access to an ADA ramp, the statement said, an autonomous version of the Elevate could walk to a front door and position itself so that a wheelchair could roll right in. \r\n",
      "How realistic is the Elevate concept?\r\n",
      "David Bailey, a professor at Aston Business School in England, told the BBC that although concept cars may not make it to the factory floor, they can help generate valuable new ideas.\r\n",
      "For most of us, its going to be wheels and roads, but in extreme situations there may be scope for this sort of thing, Bailey said. There may well be applications in terms of emergency services but there are very big technological challenges to make this sort of thing. \r\n",
      "Hyundais vision is undeniably ambitious. The company said it envisions being able to switch out different Elevate body types for different situations. The vehicle is designed to utilize both mammalian and reptilian walking gaits, giving it the ability to travel in any direction, the company said, noting that the legs fold up into a stowed drive-mode to save power.\r\n",
      "Those legs, the company said, would be able to climb over a five-foot wall and step across a five-foot gap.\r\n",
      "A concept video produced by Hyundai shows the vehicle performing a mixture of driving and walking. When the surface is relatively flat, the vehicle turns to conventional wheels, but when the terrain grows craggy, the vehicles wheels appear to lock into place and its legs extend, taking synchronized steps forward.\r\n",
      "When surrounded by massive chunks of concrete from what appears to be a collapsed structure, Elevate is shown leveling itself on an incline so that rescuers can load a stretcher inside.\r\n",
      "Imagine a car stranded in a snow ditch just 10 feet off the highway being able to walk or climb over the treacherous terrain, back to the road, potentially saving its injured passengers this is the future of vehicular mobility, said David Byron, industrial design manager at Sundberg-Ferar, a Detroit-based design firm that partnered with Hyundai to create the Elevate.\n",

      "Content:  330 A member of the family that owns OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma told people at the prescription opioid painkiller's launch party in the 1990s that it would be \"followed by a blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition,\" according to court documents filed Tuesday.\r\n",
      "The details were made public in a case brought by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey that accuses Purdue Pharma, its executives and members of the Sackler family of deceiving patients and doctors about the risks of opioids and pushing prescribers to keep patients on the drug longer. The documents provide information about former Purdue Pharma President Richard Sackler's role in overseeing sales of OxyContin that hasn't been public before.\r\n",
      "The drug and the closely held Connecticut company that sells it are at the center of a lawsuit in Massachusetts and hundreds of others across the country in which government entities are trying to find the drug industry responsible for an opioid crisis that killed 72,000 Americans in 2017. The Massachusetts litigation is separate from some 1,500 federal lawsuits filed by governments being overseen by a judge in Cleveland.\r\n",
      "But the company documents at the heart of the Massachusetts allegations are also part of the evidence exchanged in those cases. While the Massachusetts filing describes their contents, the documents themselves have not been made public, at the company's request.\r\n",
      "According to the filing, Richard Sackler, then senior vice president responsible for sales, told the audience at the launch party to imagine a series of natural disasters: an earthquake, volcanic eruption, hurricane and blizzard.\r\n",
      "\"The launch of OxyContin Tablets will be followed by a blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition. The prescription blizzard will be so deep, dense, and white,\" he said, according to the documents.\r\n",
      "\"Over the next twenty years, the Sacklers made Richard's boast come true,\" lawyers in the attorney general's office wrote. \"They created a manmade disaster. Their blizzard of dangerous prescriptions buried children and parents and grandparents across Massachusetts, and the burials continue,\" they wrote.\r\n",
      "The complaint says the Sackler family, which includes major donors to museums including the Smithsonian Institution, New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Tate Modern in London, was long aware its drug was dangerous and addictive but pushed more sales anyway.\r\n",
      "A memo among family members in 2008 warned of a \"dangerous concentration of risk\" for the family, the complaint says. Years earlier, Richard Sackler wrote in an email that the company would have to \"hammer on the abusers in every way possible,\" describing them as \"the culprits and the problem.\"\r\n",
      "Joanne Peterson, who runs a Massachusetts-based support network for the family members of people addicted to drugs, said Sackler's comments show a \"blatant disregard for human life.\"\r\n",
      "\"He certainly hammered them six feet under,\" Peterson said. \"I've been to more funerals than I can count in the last 15 years.\"\r\n",
      "Purdue Pharma accused the attorney general's office of cherry-picking from millions of emails and documents to create \"biased and inaccurate characterizations\" of the company and its executives.

      "Beauregard, Alabama (CNN)Trying to figure out what happened over the phone was torture. \r\n",
      "A murderous EF-4 tornado had leveled her parents' neighborhood in this rural swath of southeast Alabama. Krystal Stenson-Garrett -- two hours north at her kitchen table in Birmingham -- was shaking.\r\n",
      "She was on the phone with her cousin, Montasha Preston, who was in Beauregard, frantically trying to reach their childhood homes, three doors down from each other. \r\n",
      "Preston couldn't reach the neighborhood by car, so she got out and ran a half mile, hopping over downed trees and ducking under power lines. \r\n",
      "Stenson-Garrett, 35, felt helpless. She pressed for answers, but Preston didn't have any yet. She would call back when she had more information.\r\n",
      "Then the calls started coming.\r\n",
      "The first brought good news. Stenson-Garrett's nephews, Eric, 17, and Dillian, 14, had been found. The storm had yanked them from her parents' mobile home and tossed them across the street. They were hurt -- Eric badly -- but they were alive. \r\n",
      "Preston called back. They had found Stenson-Garrett's dad.\r\n",
      "\"No, not thank God, Krystal,\" Preston replied. \"He didn't make it.\" \r\n",
      "In the next call, Stenson-Garrett learned the twister had also taken her mother and only brother. In the final call, she was told her uncle was dead, too. \r\n",
      "Of the 23 people killed in the deadliest US tornado in almost six years, four were her kin. \r\n",
      "Rescue worker: 'It's all been put in a blender and blown for miles'\r\n",
      "Days after the tornado, residents in this neighborhood along Lee Road 39 are struggling to process the devastation around them. There are areas a mile wide where no structure survived. \r\n",
      "The tornado smashed homes into each other, combining their contents into mammoth piles of wreckage. Brick homes are missing their roofs. Steel beams are twisted like shoelaces. Foundations sit empty like basketball courts. Wrecked cars and riding mowers rest atop mounds of rubble. Tall trees have been reduced to 6-foot mangled stumps.\r\n",
      "\"You know the area, and you get to a point where you don't know the area anymore,\" said Mike Pooler, a drone systems instructor who has been working with a makeshift search-and-rescue team. \"The houses on the hill are now in a pile.\"\r\n",
      "The horizon, long obscured by dense woods, is visible in the distance. \r\n",
      "The flotsam from the storm provides a window into the lives it overturned. Baby shoes. Broken china. Shrink-wrappedchickens. Liquor bottles. Shotgun shells. Unopened bills. A coloring book. American flag cornhole bags. Medicine bottles. Lots and lots of photos. \r\n",
      "\"It's all been put in a blender and it's just been blown for miles all over creation,\" said Adam Littleton, 40, a bus driver also helping the search team.\r\n",
      "Recovery, where it's possible, will take months or longer. The buzz of chainsaws and scent of pine sap are everywhere, but even in this wasteland there's a palpable belief among residents that this town can bounce back, especially the way the community has come together. \r\n",
      "Many here will tell you the tornado is God testing them, and He would never put more on them than they can handle. \r\n",
      "Survivors are putting aside their own sorrow to help others\r\n",
      "The home of James and Stephanie Taunton was rocked so hard they can see daylight between the roof and a bedroom wall. \r\n",
      "Their son, Zachary, 5, rode the school bus with one of the child victims, Armondo Hernandez, leaving the beleaguered parents to broach the realities of death with the boy sooner than they'd planned. \r\n",
      "As he awaited financial assistance at a Disabled American Veterans table that had set up shop at Providence Baptist Church, James Taunton, 45, bristled at the notion he was a victim. \r\n",
      "\"We didn't really lose anything. Literally, two miles from my house they have no home,\" he said. \"I feel guilty ... How am I allowed to have my family intact and they're not?\"\r\n",
      "Stories abound here of people putting aside their own sorrow to help others. Ask them about their losses and they're quick to point to someone who lost more. \r\n",
      "As bad as it is, it could've been worse. The tornado struck mid-afternoon Sunday, when many folks were at restaurants, eating lunch after church.\r\n",
      "Lee County Coroner Bill Harris, who had to process 23 bodies from his mobile autopsy suite at a local middle school, said the death toll might have been higher if more residents had been home. \r\n",
      "Justin Miller of nearby Opelika lost his mother, accountant and novelist Charlotte Miller, in the storm. Though she suffered from arthritis and didn't get around well, she received a steroid injection so she could walk him down the aisle at his wedding. He loved his mama dearly. \r\n",
      "\"People lost whole families and every belonging,\" said the 29-year-old. \"I want more for them than for us because we're fine. ... We're lucky and blessed because we have that closure and we know what to do.\"\r\n",
      "A teen girl is reunited with her lost pet bunny\r\n",
      "At Providence Baptist Church in Opelika on Tuesday, scores of volunteers scrambled to feed folks and organize the stream of clothes, food and cleaning supplies arriving at the church's community center. \r\n",
      "Pooler and Bobby Dempsey waited at a tent where volunteers were making tacos for search crews. Pooler, 39, collected his meal and walked toward the church, a tattered white bunny with blue eyes tucked into his left arm. \r\n",
      "Dempsey, 41, had found the rabbit under a 4-foot pile of drywall, flooring, shingles and furniture, he said. It was tame, obviously a pet, so the men posted a photo to Facebook. \r\n",
      "As church volunteers gathered around, oohing and ahhing over the ball of cuteness, a man came out of the church and flagged down Pooler. They'd found the rabbit's owner. \r\n",
      "Euel Partridge, 54, arrived an hour or so later. The bunny belonged to his 16-year-old daughter, Laklyn. She called her Thumper, but Partridge joked that Thumper, of \"Bambi\" fame, was a boy, so he preferred Bun-Bun. \r\n",
      "When the tornado hit his home on Lee Road 38, Partridge and his wife hunkered down in the middle of the house. \r\n",
      "\"It was like an earthquake. The walls were moving back and forth,\" he said. \"I grabbed my wife around the waist and said, 'If we're going to die, we're going to die together.'\"\r\n",
      "The storm sent them flying and they landed in the back yard next to his lawnmower, its steering wheel sheared clean off. \r\n",
      "If you saw his house, he said, you wouldn't believe anyone inside survived, but Laklyn was released from the hospital Sunday. His wife was fitted for a neck brace and he suffered a broken vertebra but could still walk. \r\n",
      "Their cat was missing, but they'd found their Labrador retriever and chihuahua. And now, \"Bun-Bun the miracle bunny,\" he said. \r\n",
      "\"I'm amazed she's alive,\" Partridge said. \"I'm amazed we're alive. I'm amazed any of us are alive.\"\r\n",
      "A shattered family must plan four burials\r\n",
      "Outside an Opelika funeral home, Stenson-Garrett and a dozen family members gathered Wednesday to help each other through the hardest week of their lives. \r\n",
      "There were four burials to plan: Stenson-Garrett's parents, Henry Stenson and Florel Tate Stenson, 65 and 63. Her brother, Eric Stenson, 38. And her uncle, James Tate, 86.\r\n",
      "Then there's the story of young Dillian and Eric Stenson Jr., who Stenson-Garrett described as \"walking miracles.\"\r\n",
      "\"We were told no one could've survived it, and they did,\" Stenson-Garrett said. \r\n",
      "When they came to after the tornado blew through their grandparents' home, Dillian's back was hurt. He couldn't move, he said, but Eric made him, despite severe injuries of his own. \r\n",
      "Eric didn't know where their family was, so he ushered his little brother to their father's car and they laid on the horn until a great unclefound them. \r\n",
      "On Wednesday Eric sat in a wheelchair, nursing a broken shoulder blade, a punctured lung and stitches in his foot and toe.\r\n",
      "Trauma hung on his and Dillian's faces, reducing their voices to whispers. \r\n",
      "The brothers lost their dad and grandparents. They still have their mother in nearby Auburn, but the family knows she'll need help with them. \r\n",
      "\"We're going to raise these boys together,\" said Stenson-Garrett, who has two young daughters of her own. \"I could not live on this Earth and not do what my mother has preached to me. I gotta do what I gotta do.\"\r\n",
      "'It's beautiful to see how the community has come together'\r\n",
      "Stenson-Garrett's cousin, Carlton Lilly, and her uncle, Terry Tate, walked a reporter down Lee Road 38, where four generations of Tates and Stensons have grown up.\r\n",
      "There were so many kids, Lilly said, that when the cousins got off the school bus at grandma's house, the bus would be empty. \r\n",
      "Lilly's 18-wheeler was parked in front of his aunt and uncle's home when the tornado picked it up and wrapped it around a tree across the street, coiling the chassis as if it were aluminum. \r\n",
      "Lilly, 34, was lying face down in his mobile home when the twister struck. He remembers feeling weightless for a spell and then landing against a tree in his back yard. \r\n",
      "\"I thought I was the only one who survived when I saw all those houses (gone),\" he said.\r\n",
      "Before he could gather his bearings, his phone went off again. Another tornado was touching down. Lilly saw the swirling clouds, and with no buildings left in which to seek shelter, he dove into a ditch, praying for forgiveness. \r\n",
      "As he recounted his story Wednesday, a fellow truck driver walked up and gave him a hug and a box of clothes. Lilly's home is gone, as is his rig, his livelihood. He has staples in his leg and an ankle fracture, but he wouldn't accept sympathy. \r\n",
      "\"Don't be sorry. I made it,\" he said. \"You could be doing this interview with just my uncle.\"\r\n",
      "A few doors down at the remains of Lilly's grandparents' home, Stenson-Garrett surveyed the pile of cinderblocks, tears fresh in her eyes from witnessing the wreckage in person. \r\n",
      "Memories are all that remain of this road where she, her brother and cousins grew up enjoying her mother's stellar cooking. Stenson-Garrett loved to bring her daughters here to visit \"the best granddad ever.\" \r\n",
      "They'd just finished a visit Sunday. They were supposed to stay for church, but she left in the morning to beat the storm. She didn't want to drive in the rain.\r\n",
      "On Wednesday Stenson-Garrett was elated when one of her parents' neighbors presented her with the sonogram of her oldest daughter, found down the road. Another neighbor salvaged an old photo of her parents in their twenties. \r\n",
      "Up and down the street, residents fished photos from rubble and tree limbs, showing them to neighbors in hopes of returning them to their owners. \r\n",
      "\"I can't believe these people are down here doing this right now. These are people I've never seen in my life,\" Stenson-Garrett said. \"It's sad, but it's beautiful to see how the community has really come together.\"\n",

      "Shares in Japan’s sixth-largest automaker fell nearly 7 percent at one point before recovering some ground after the company announced further details, including plans to restart production on Monday at the earliest. In mid-afternoon trade, the stock was down 2.6 percent, while the benchmark Nikkei average was flat. \r\n",
      "The production stoppage, which started from the night shift on Jan. 16 at one of Subaru’s only two factories worldwide, was first reported in the Asahi newspaper on Wednesday. \r\n",
      "The possible defect affected the Forester, Impreza, and XV models, the automaker said. Production of all other models had also stopped because they are built on the same assembly line, it said. \r\n",

      "The Asahi newspaper said the impact on production so far likely exceeded 10,000 units, and that delays were starting to be seen in delivery to customers. \r\n",
      "Subaru said the cause of the potential defect was still unknown. It declined to comment on why the problem was not disclosed earlier. \r\n",
      "Vehicles with the possible defect were produced between late December and Jan. 16, and “appropriate” steps would be taken to ensure the safety of those cars, it added without elaborating. \r\n",

      "Content:  335 BRUMADINHO, Brazil Luiz de Castro was installing lamps at a mining complex in Brazil late last month when a loud blast split the air. He figured it was just a truck tire popping, but a friend knew better.\r\n",
      "No, its not that! the friend said. Run!\r\n",
      "Dashing up a staircase, caked in mud and pelted by flying rocks, Mr. Castro clambered to safety. But as he watched, a wall of mud unleashed by the collapse of a mining dam swallowed his co-workers, he said. Tiago, George, Icaro they and at least 154 others, all buried alive.\r\n",
      "The deluge of toxic mud stretched for five miles, crushing homes, offices and people a tragedy, but hardly a surprise, experts say.\r\n",
      "There are 88 mining dams in Brazil built like the one that failed enormous reservoirs of mining waste held back by little more than walls of sand and silt. And all but four of the dams have been rated by the government as equally vulnerable, or worse.\r\n",
      "Even more alarming, at least 28 sit directly uphill from cities or towns, with more than 100,000 people living in especially risky areas if the dams failed, an estimate by The New York Times found.\r\n",
      "In the disaster last month, all the elements for catastrophe were there: A bare-bones reservoir of mining waste built on the cheap, sitting above a large town nestled underneath. Overlooked warnings of structural problems that could lead to a collapse. Monitoring equipment that had stopped working.\r\n",
      "And perhaps above all, a country where a powerful mining industry has been free to act more or less unchecked.\r\n",
      "The threat of poorly constructed mining dams in Brazil goes far beyond one company. The latest deadly failure the second in Brazil in three years has made it clear that neither the mining industry nor regulators have the situation under control.\r\n",

Still, the company, which bought the mining complex in 2001, defended its management of the dam, which had been sitting there, inactive, since 2016.\r\n",

      "Many engineers cautioned that it was too soon to draw firm conclusions about what precisely went wrong with the structure in Brumadinho, called Dam I of the Córrego do Feijão Mine. And they said it was possible to build upstream tailings dams safely.\r\n",
      "Theres nothing blatantly wrong with this method of construction, said W. Allen Marr, founder and chief executive of Geocomp, based in Boston, and a member of the national academy. When the structures fail, Mr. Marr said, its usually a combination of several things that should have been done but dont get done.\r\n",
      "In 2010, Washington Pirete, whose LinkedIn profile and a professional publication list him as a longtime Vale employee, wrote a masters thesis focused on the dam at Brumadinho. Mr. Pirete concluded that the risks of liquefaction were low to moderate, but several engineers say now that his analysis, if anything, cast doubt on the safety of the dam.\r\n",
      "Mr. Marr said that Mr. Piretes safety calculations raise questions about the stability of the dam. Mr. Van Zyl said that if he had calculated the safety margins Mr. Pirete found for the dam, I wouldnt sleep well. He said his first reaction on seeing the thin margins was that the dam should have failed earlier, almost.\r\n",
      "Mr. Pirete did not respond to several requests for comment.\r\n",
      "The thesis describes a method of construction, which began in 1976, that is in many ways routine for upstream dams.\r\n",
      "A so-called starter dike was built across the valley above Brumadinho, and the mining company piped waste behind it. When the waste neared the top of the dike, the company built another slightly uphill hence the name upstream construction. The second dike sat directly on the hardened mud.\r\n",
      "Over the decades, a towering structure rose over the mining complex, its integrity dependent entirely on the solidity of the mud.\r\n",
      "A closer look at Mr. Piretes figures, some of which were scarcely above the collapse threshold, left some engineers questioning how Mr. Pirete could have considered the dam safe.\r\n",
      "Thats way too close to the margin, Mr. Baecher said.\r\n",
      "Last year, a German company hired by Vale took its own look at the dam and calculated higher stability factors than Mr. Pirete did but it did raise safety concerns.\r\n",
      "The company Tüv Süd found blocked drainage pipes and cracks, and made note of a small wooden structure that had been erected to stop part of the dam from slumping. The company also found water visibly seeping from at least one area, and said there was a risk of liquefaction.\r\n",
      "To reduce the risk of triggering a collapse through vibrations, they advised Vale to avoid letting heavy equipment onto the dam or allowing detonations nearby. They also advised work to keep the water level from rising.\r\n",
      "Two weeks after the Brumadinho tragedy, sirens went off in the middle of the night 76 miles away, in the town of Barão de Cocais. Attention! This is a real dam break emergency, loudspeakers blasted. Abandon your homes immediately.\r\n",
      "The alarms wreaked havoc as nearly 500 people were ordered to evacuate. Vale, which owns the mining complex in Barão de Cocais, called it a preventive measure, explaining it had initiated its emergency plan after the consulting firm Walm refused to attest to the dams stability.\r\n",

      "Three years ago, a similar dam burst in the city of Mariana, 75 miles away, killing 19 people and unleashing one of the worst environmental disasters in Brazilian history. That dam was jointly owned by Vale and the Anglo-Australian mining company BHP.\r\n",
      "After the Mariana collapse, officials vowed to adopt rigorous safety protocols. That never happened.\r\n",

It remains the hub of Brazils mining industry, producing 53 percent of the countrys output, with more mines and tailings dams than any other Brazilian state. Here, critics say, the laws are written by the mining companies, not for them.\r\n",
      "Last December, an extraordinary meeting of the state council on mining regulations was called to vote on a proposal by Vale to expand operations at Córrego de Feijão and another mine. The proposal had been declared a priority by the state.\r\n",
      "Maria Teresa Corujo, an activist who represents the community vote on the council, angrily pointed out that council members had been given just four business days to pore over thousands of documents.\r\n",
      "The environmental management of our state continues to be focused on the G.D.P. index, on mining interests, she said, according to minutes of the meeting that were sent to The Times. This is destroying Minas Gerais.\r\n",
      "Júlio Cesar Dutra Grillo, the state representative from the federal environmental protection agency, warned the council that the dams were not risk free. Any negligence on the part of those conducting risk management, and they rupture, he said.\r\n",
      "The proposal passed with one dissenting vote, from Ms. Corujo, and an abstention by Mr. Grillo.\r\n",
      "The board's decision came despite growing concern about accidents after the Mariana dam collapse. In public hearings, activists in Brumadinho would try to convince residents that tourism, not mining, was the citys path forward.\r\n",

      "Content:  336 The whale sighting happened right away, minutes into Day 1. Jon, Dave and I had just been dropped off on a remote Alaskan shoreline, an hour and a half by boat from the closest speck of a town. Jon was working as a sea-kayaking guide that summer in Glacier Bay National Park, and he had invited us up for a seven-day excursion during his week off. As the boat that delivered us vanished, the drone of its engine dampening into a murmur and then finally trailing off, it became unthinkably quiet on the beach, and the largeness and strangeness of our surroundings were suddenly apparent. It was a familiar phenomenon for Jon from the start of all his trips: a moment that people instinctually paused to soak in. To me, it felt like those scenes of astronauts who, having finally rattled free of the earth’s atmosphere, slip into the stillness of space. Except we weren’t in space. We were on earth — finally, really on earth.\r\n",
      "We were only starting to move around again, packing our gear into the kayaks, when we heard the first huff of a blowhole, not far offshore.\r\n",
      "Jon was ecstatic. It seemed to him as if the animal were putting on a show, swimming playfully in the kelp, diving, resurfacing, then plowing its open mouth across the surface to feed. He took it as a good omen. Though I had no idea at the time, he was anxious that Dave and I might feel intimidated about making the trip; such a big payoff, so quickly, would get us excited and defuse any apprehensions.\r\n",
      "For Dave, the whale-sighting had exactly the opposite effect. Once, when he was a kid, his dad took him scuba diving with dolphins. They were friendly, awe-inspiring creatures, purportedly, but they terrified Dave instead. He could still conjure the feeling of hanging defenselessly in that water while the animals deftly swirled around him, less like solid objects than flashes of reflected light, while he could move only in comparative slow-motion. Ever since, he had harbored a fear of large sea creatures — a niche phobia, particularly for a young man who lived in the Bronx, but a genuine one still. And so, even as Dave understood that a chance to see whales up close like this was a major draw of a kayaking trip in Alaska, and though he feigned being thrilled, some second thoughts were kicking in: We were going out there, he realized.\r\n",
      "The whale left me exhilarated and gleeful, like Jon; but deeper down, I also remember feeling shaken, like Dave. Nothing about the animal registered to me as playful or welcoming. It just appeared in the distance, then transited quickly past us, from left to right. My uneasiness had something to do with the whale’s great size and indifference — its obliviousness — as it passed. Watching it made me feel profoundly out of place and register how large that wilderness was, relative to me.\r\n",
      "At the time, I was working at a literary magazine in New York City called The Hudson Review, picking poems out of the slush pile and mailing them to an outside panel of editorial advisers. I was trying hard in my letters to impress one of them: Hayden Carruth, a gruff and irreverent 81-year-old poet who lived far upstate. I loved Carruth’s work but was more enamored with his persona: his yeoman life in the woods, his intolerance for phoniness and, most of all, the precision with which he articulated common suffering, including one strain of his own suffering that I related to, particularly in those years, but wouldn’t have had the courage, or clarity, to examine.\r\n",
      "“I had always been aware,” Carruth once wrote of his youth, “that the Universe is sad; everything in it, animate or inanimate, the wild creatures, the stones, the stars, was enveloped in the great sadness, pervaded by it. ... Never then or now have I been able to look at a cloudless sky at night and see beauty there. A kind of grandeur, yes — but not beauty. The profusion and variety of celestial lights have always frightened me. Why are they there? Why these instead of others? Why these instead of nothing?”\r\n",
      "That was how I felt, watching the whale from the beach: afraid that everything was accidents. Then again, maybe it’s just hard to picture the start of the trip in retrospect without amplifying some feeling of foreboding. Something else Carruth wrote that has always stuck with me: “The wilderness begins at the edge of my body, at the edge of my consciousness, and extends to the edge of the universe, and it is filled with menace.”\r\n",

      "It was mid-August 2002, and we were 23, 24 and 25. We had graduated from college together two years earlier. Dave, whom I also grew up with, shot out of undergrad knowing he wanted to be a doctor and had just finished his first year of medical school. Any similar momentum I had after graduation was instantly sapped. Three nights after I returned to my parents’ house from school, I found myself driving my father to the emergency room. Three weeks after that, he died. My grief was disorienting and total; at a moment in life when everything is supposed to feel possible, making any single decision became impossible. I gave into that sadness for the better part of a year, resettling at home in New Jersey with my widowed mother and sliding back to the summer job I worked during school, glumly breaking down beef at a butcher shop two towns over.\r\n",
      "I coped with my fatherlessness and confusion in ways I’m not proud of and still don’t understand. I read a lot of books about Ronald Reagan, for example, even the collection of his love letters to Nancy. I also lashed out at Dave, who was living at home that summer, too, studying for the MCAT. He withdrew awkwardly after the funeral, and I suppose I was happy to hold that against him. It triggered some longstanding jealousy. A part of me always resented how he seemed unfairly exempt from the self-doubt and heaviness that I was prone to.\r\n",
      "Jon, meanwhile, was teaching at a rustic little boarding school in Switzerland, where his mother was from. The summer after graduation, before starting the job, he set out for Alaska with a friend, sleeping in the bed of their old pickup. In the minuscule town of Gustavus, the gateway to Glacier Bay, he picked up seasonal work in the warehouse of a kayak-tour company. Jon had little actual experience of sea kayaking but had always felt drawn to the ocean in the abstract. In college, he and another friend plotted out a paddling expedition near Glacier Bay, across the border in Canada and applied for a grant from our school to fund it. The grant was set up in memory of an alumnus who died in an avalanche while mountaineering. It was meant to encourage the “responsible and conscientious pursuit of wilderness expeditions.” Safety was key. But the committee rejected Jon and his partner’s application. They seemed insufficiently prepared.\r\n",
      "That wasn’t surprising. Jon grew up doing a lot of backcountry camping and was a competent outdoorsman, but putting together a grant application required a kind of administrative fastidiousness he didn’t always possess. He was bright but scatterbrained, forever picking up things and putting them down, both figuratively (music projects, conversations) but also literally. I can still picture him hustling around the house we shared in college, hunting for his keys or his soldering iron, having gotten in over his head rewiring some device. He was an artist; one piece I remember consisted of a half-peeled banana, implanted with circuitry and suspended in a jar of formaldehyde. Once, he grew grass in our upstairs bathroom — a living bathmat, he said — until the turf became muddy and flooded the downstairs.\r\n",
      "This was Jon’s third summer in Alaska, and he’d worked his way up to leading expeditions, taking out vacationers for days at a time. Our trip, however, would venture beyond the typical circuit, into a remote corner of the park that he’d never been to. Jon had no serious concerns about our safety, but he felt he bore responsibility for our emotional well-being. To enjoy ourselves, we would need to feel comfortable, not just in the wilderness but also with him as a leader.\r\n",
      "He suspected we wouldn’t trust him entirely. We didn’t. We knew him before he became a professional guide, and our perception of his expertise lagged behind the reality. “With Jon,” Dave told me, “it was always unclear to what extent he’d thought everything through.” Dave remembered landing in Gustavus the night before we got underway and casually asking Jon a lot of questions: Where are we going, exactly? Do we have everything we need? Jon seemed to have solid answers for all of them. As we headed back to his place for a good night’s sleep, he told us to wait in the yard. He was living alone for the summer in a house that an acquaintance was building in the woods. The structure was framed-up but largely wall-less, and Jon, to be safe, needed to check that no moose had wandered in.\r\n",
      "After a spectacular first day of paddling, we came ashore on a rocky tidal flat about two miles from where we were dropped. Jon gave us his detailed tutorial about bear safety while we set up our campsite. He taught us, for example, to holler “Hey, bear!” if we heard any rustling but also preventively, ahead of us, when we walked through the woods. The last thing you wanted was to come across a brown bear unannounced.\r\n",
      "“Hey, bear!” Jon kept hollering, by way of demonstration. He said it goofily, like a children’s TV host greeting some down-on-his-luck ursine neighbor at the doorway to their clubhouse. This was intentional. Jon had noticed that the people on his trips often resisted bellowing “Hey, bear!” into the wilderness. It was essential for their safety, but it felt silly or vulnerable somehow, like singing in public. So he learned to turn it into a shtick, spinning it into a stream-of-consciousness narration: Hey, bear, I’m coming into the trees now. Hope you’re having a fantastic evening, Mr. Bear! It loosened everyone up. They were performing for their friends now; the whole group was in on the joke.\r\n",
      "I had never seen a wild bear, though I have backpacked in bear country a handful of times. I felt comfortable with the animals in the abstract. But here, the bears weren’t abstract; they breached the material plane. There were bear trails everywhere, leading from the tree line to the water, and disquietingly close, I felt, to where we were pitching our tent. We found heaps of their scat. We saw trees where the animals had slashed off the bark to eat the inner layer, tufts of fur from their paws still plastered in the sap.\r\n",
      "I pretended I was having fun. But that evening I grew increasingly petrified, almost delirious. My eyes tightened, scanning for bears. The sound of the wind became bears, and so did the mossy sticks cracking under our feet. I gave myself a migraine, then phased in and out of sleep.\r\n",
      "At sunrise, I woke feeling foolish. While Jon cooked pancakes, I reasoned with myself, privately, in a notebook I brought on the trip. I tried to conceive of the situation as a geometry problem. Yes, some number of bears roved this landscape, I wrote: relatively tiny, independent blips, going about their business randomly, just like us. In all that empty space and confusion, a lethal collision of their moving blips and our moving blips would be an improbable coincidence. I’d been distorting those odds, mistaking myself for “the absolute focus of all bears’ attention,” I wrote. It was embarrassing, really. “To be afraid of bears,” I concluded, “is to be narcissistic.”\r\n",
      "I was reminding myself that freakishly horrible things are, by definition, unlikely to happen. Even now, my reasoning feels sound.\r\n",
      "[Read about the search for a missing hiker in Joshua Tree’s wild interior.]\r\n",
      "Day 2 was a slog. We paddled through a spitting drizzle in an endless straight line, along the high granite walls of the coast. We talked less and less, just pushed through the emerald chop. Then eventually we gave up, hauling in our boats and making camp in a wide, crescent-shaped cove, short of the site that Jon originally picked out on his map.\r\n",
      "We had entered Dundas Bay, a rarely visited pocket of the national park that, I’ve since learned, has a storied history as a hide-out for solitary misanthropes. In the 1930s, one prospector built a cabin not far from our campsite and brandished a gun at the Alaska Natives who passed through.\r\n",
      "We intuited that the scenery was beautiful, but we could see very little of it through the fog. Our guidebook explained that “the east side of the bay” — where we were — “can get extremely rough during foul weather, since large waves roll in ... and batter this shoreline.” That was happening now: The weather that plinked at us all afternoon was roiling into a storm. Soon, the big rain started. We rushed through dinner, then loafed in our tent until, eventually, the loafing turned to sleep.\r\n",
      "A local newspaper would later describe the storm as “short but intense.” In Gustavus, a creek swelled to about a foot higher than its previous record. Gale winds, with gusts up to 59 miles per hour, turned back two cruise ships in Skagway, about 85 miles north. Around 2 a.m., we woke to discover the wind had shorn the rain fly off our tent. Jon’s sleeping bag and mine were soaked, while Dave was snug and dry between us. We heard torrents of water lashing down and the waves crashing in the cove.\r\n",
      "We got up three or four hours later. The rain and wind no longer felt ferocious but were still too gnarly to paddle through; there was no question, Jon said, that we were staying put. We cooked breakfast and took turns playing chess in the tent. By late morning, the storm seemed to have passed. We were antsy. We figured we would take a look around.\r\n",
      "The terrain was crammed with thickets of alder and spruce, underlain by ferns and a furor of prickly things. Jon pointed out devil’s club: three or four feet tall and leafy, armored up and down with spines. The plant pierced fleece and hurt like fire.\r\n",
      "There were no trails. We’d been trudging for some time when we reached a fast-moving stream, maybe 10 feet wide. Jon was surprised; it wasn’t on his map, most likely just a drainage bloated by the storm. We followed it downstream, looking for a way across, and eventually found it bridged by a hefty tree trunk. It seemed like an easy crossing. Jon stepped up and led the way, and Dave and I waited in a single-file line on the stream bank behind him. The creek was loud, like a factory with all its gears and rollers churning. Looking down, Jon realized there was more water than he’d thought.\r\n",
      "That’s when I heard the snap in the woods behind me. After all my paranoia, I instantly understood that the many bears I’d thought I heard before were absolutely not bears — were nothing — because this sound was so unmistakable and crisp, so explicitly something. I turned and hollered, “Hey, bear!” then waited a beat. Maybe I said “Hey, bear!” again; I’m not sure. But I must have scanned those trees long enough to feel satisfied and safe, because I know I was turning my head, to go back to my friends, when I saw the dark shape rushing forward in my peripheral vision.\r\n",
      "What I heard must have been roots popping. If a tree is large enough, you can apparently hear them cracking underground like gunfire.\r\n",
      "The thud was seismic. The trunk crashed down right next to me. Mapping out bits of evidence later, we concluded that the tree must have been about 80 feet tall and perhaps two feet in diameter. It was some kind of conifer — a spruce or cedar. I screamed, involuntarily, “Look out!” then watched Dave, a few steps directly in front of me, dive sideways and hit the ground. When I got to him, he was crouching, stunned but O.K. He looked up and said, “Go get Jon.”\r\n",
      "It hadn’t clicked back in for me: There were three of us. The sight of Dave going down had canceled out everything else. I scrambled out over the creek, running across the tree that had just fallen, shouting Jon’s name, then spotted him in the water, tangled in a snarl of sheared-off branches near the bank behind me — a cage, which kept him from hurtling downstream.\r\n",
      "He did not know he’d been hit by a falling tree. It had narrowly missed his head, struck his left shoulder, shearing it from his collarbone and breaking many of his ribs. Later, a doctor would explain that the downward force had been so powerful that it had probably squashed Jon’s entire upper body, and all the organs inside, down toward his waist, momentarily compressing him like a bellows; for a split second, his shoulders headed in the direction of his bellybutton, before his torso sprang up again.\r\n",
      "Jon had heard nothing, seen nothing. He was turning around to help Dave onto the log — again, feeling responsible for our safety — and the next thing he knew, he was in the water. He tried to reach out his left arm but could not make it move. He could not move his legs. He felt a bolt of pain down his spine.\r\n",
      "Jon later described flashing through an idiosyncratic sequence of thoughts, all in a few milliseconds, as if watching a deck of cards fanning across a table. One was an image of himself in a wheelchair, sitting behind a mixing console in a fancy recording studio. “I guess I can become a recording engineer in a wheelchair,” he remembered thinking. He had never worked in a recording studio and, though he played music, he had no particular plans to. Still, this vision apparently felt like an acceptable future and freed him to resurface in the present. That was when he registered me, screaming his name.\r\n",
      "Jon told himself he shouldn’t move. He knew from his many wilderness first-responder trainings that moving a person with spinal injuries risks paralysis. Then again, he also knew that most of his body was submerged in cold water, and he recognized that he risked dying of hypothermia if he didn’t move. “If I’m already paralyzed,” he concluded, “I may as well move.”\r\n",
      "He somehow hoisted himself out of the stream before Dave or I got to him, using his right arm and his chin and biting into something loamy with his teeth, for additional leverage. He reassessed the situation: better. Also: worse. He now realized that we were at least a mile inland from our camp.\r\n",
      "Suddenly, his body was walking; his legs just started working. Dave and I put him between us, supporting his frame. He was moving faster than we expected, but uncoordinatedly. Then he crumpled between us. We tried again; Jon was dead weight. Dave noticed that his breathing was shallow and his voice was low — signs, Dave knew from med school, of a collapsed lung. He began battering Jon with a pep talk, telling him, firmly, that he had to get up, that we had to get out of here. Jon didn’t need that explained to him; he was cogent and still trying to plot our next steps in his mind. He looked down to see why this log he was resting on was so lumpy and realized that he was, in fact, sitting on his left arm. The arm was slack, obviously broken; his sleeve, pierced up and down with devil’s club. Jon had zero feeling in it. He found it amusing, this sensation of complete estrangement from one of his limbs.\r\n",
      "Jon had been stressing that it was important to stay together. But this was another theory of wilderness survival that appeared to be breaking down in practice. Someone would have to get on the radio back at our camp. By chance, while marooned in our tent during the rainstorm the night before, Jon showed us how to use the device, though he did it almost as a formality; the hand-held VHF unit was merely a line-of-sight radio, he told us, meaning its range was small, its signal too weak to pass through most obstacles. You were unlikely to reach anyone you couldn’t see, and we hadn’t seen anyone since a faraway fishing boat, early on Day 1.\r\n",
      "There was a moment of discussion, or maybe just an exchange of looks between me and Dave. I told Dave he should go. I didn’t trust myself to find my way back. I also knew that I lacked the courage to try; whether I was being sensible or cowardly, I still don’t know. Besides, I took for granted that Dave would make it. He was more capable in my mind, less likely to cinch himself in indecisive knots.\r\n",
      "Recently, though, Dave told me: “You probably had no idea how much in my own head I was. I know that you, growing up, definitely felt insecure about things, and I think you looked at me and thought, Dave has everything figured out. But I had so much anxiety.” He brought up the tremor he used to have in his hands. I knew about it; in high school, we waited tables together, and I occasionally had to carry out Dave’s soup orders, so he wouldn’t spill. But I guess I thought of the tremor as strictly physiological. I couldn’t see the vulnerability causing it.\r\n",
      "Now, as Dave sprinted away from me and Jon, swatting devil’s club from his path with the rubberized sleeve of his rain jacket, his nerves rose up and rattled him. He worried he wouldn’t be able to find the radio once he got back or know how to turn it on. What if he broke the radio, foreclosing whatever marginal chance we had of getting help? There were lots of ways to screw this up, Dave realized. More occurred to him as he ran.\r\n",
      "He found the radio. He turned it on. Then, having solved these problems, he encountered another he hadn’t anticipated: “What is the appropriate thing you’re supposed to say?” he remembered thinking. On TV, you see a lot of people saying “Mayday.” And so, Dave faced the open water and started broadcasting into the fog: “Mayday, Mayday.” Even in that moment, though, alone on a beach in the middle of nowhere, he felt slightly self-conscious about it. This is so goddamn cliché, he thought.\r\n",
      "Back in the woods, kneeling over Jon, I was having the same problem: I didn’t know what to say. He was lying near a log on his injured side, his beard and glasses flecked with dirt and tendrils of moss. He seemed to be on the brink of losing consciousness. At no time would the possibility of Jon’s dying surface concretely in any of our minds. Still, I knew I was supposed to keep talking to him, to tether him to the world with my voice somehow.\r\n",
      "I started vamping platitudes: We were going to get out of here soon, and so forth. But I could feel myself treading water, even blundering, at one point, into a long-winded apology, worried I overstayed my welcome that one Christmas with his family. I was afraid that the helplessness in my voice might be counterproductive, unsettling Jon instead of steadying him. It was a tremendous silence to fill.\r\n",
      "What can a person say? I had two literature professors in college who made us memorize poems. You never knew when some lines of verse would come in handy, they claimed. One liked to brag that, while traveling through Ireland, he found that if he spat out some Yeats at a pub, he could drink free. This is how I wound up reciting a love poem to Jon.\r\n",
      "It was “The Shampoo,” by Elizabeth Bishop, a lyric poem about the enormity of time, which turns startlingly intimate at the end, when Bishop offers to shampoo her lover’s silvering hair: “Come, let me wash it in this big tin basin,/battered and shiny like the moon.”\r\n",
      "After that, I imagine I also did some W.H. Auden; I knew a fair amount of Auden back then. The stuff in rhyme and meter was always easiest to memorize — “Looking up at the stars, I know quite well/That, for all they care, I can go to hell” — which is why I had a lot of Robert Frost at my disposal as well: “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,”“The Road Not Taken.” For the most part, I trafficked in hits.\r\n",
      "Jon and I would spend about an hour and a half together alone on the forest floor. I ran through everything in my quiver — Kay Ryan, A.R. Ammons, Michael Donaghy — padding each poem with little prefatory remarks, while Jon said nothing, just signaled with his eyes or produced a sound whenever I checked in. I felt like a radio D.J. playing records in the middle of the night, unsure if anyone was listening. And here’s one about owls by Richard Wilbur, I would tell Jon, and off we would go.\r\n",
      "I must have also done at least one by Hayden Carruth, my curmudgeonly pen pal at the literary magazine. Carruth’s poems didn’t lend themselves to memorization, but I’d worked hard to nail one of my favorites, in which he describes stopping to notice a deer standing in an apple thicket, then realizing the northern lights are flaring overhead. Hayden and the animal pass a moment in stillness together. “We are proud to be afraid,” he writes, “proud to share/the silent magnetic storm that destroys the stars.” Relative to that boundless violence above them, he and the deer are momentarily allied, though still not entirely connected: “a glimpse, an acknowledgment/it is enough and never enough.”\r\n",
      "That’s what I said to my friend, powerlessly, tenting my jacket over his face when it started to rain. The title of the poem is: “I Know, I Remember, But How Can I Help You.”\r\n",
      "The Coast Guard cutter Mustang wasn’t where it was supposed to be. The 110-foot patrol boat normally spent its time coursing through the Gulf of Alaska, inspecting halibut-fishing vessels, or circulating, as a terrorist deterrent, near the oil terminals at Valdez. It was home-ported in Seward, hundreds of miles from Glacier Bay. But the crew was transiting to Juneau for a training when, a few days earlier, they were smacked by the same storm that later poured inland, over us. “We had gotten absolutely pummeled,” John Roberts, a petty officer on the Mustang, told me recently. For two days, the boat swished around in 15-foot-plus seas. Many on the crew had been hunkered in the mess deck, vomiting, while Roberts and a couple of his shipmates did their best to cover everyone’s watches. Finally, the Mustang slipped into Glacier Bay to find some protection. The weather started to ease. That afternoon, as Roberts piloted the Mustang east, toward Dundas Bay, his pallid crewmates were finally staggering back up to the bridge, asking where the hell they were.\r\n",
      "That was when Dave’s Mayday call came through. The signal on the Mustang’s radio was thin and faint, barely edging into range. Another of the ship’s petty officers, Eamon McCormack, explained to me that in retrospect the connection feels “mind-boggling.” Glacier Bay National Park extends over more than 5,000 square miles. Our signal would have covered two or three miles at most. And yet, a boat — a Coast Guard boat, no less — happened to be passing through that exceedingly small window at precisely the right time. “I don’t know if, nine times out of 10, you play that over again and the outcome would be the same,” McCormack said. A moment earlier or later — seconds, potentially — and we might have slipped out of alignment. The moving boat would have cruised out of range, uncoupling from us forever.\r\n",
      "It was 1:25 p.m. when the Mustang received Dave’s call, according to one of the subsequent Coast Guard reports. Roberts couldn’t believe it. “Come on, man, I’m tired,” he said aloud, wearily, to the receiver in front of him. Roberts waited for a moment, per protocol, on the off chance that the Coast Guard’s central communications center in Juneau would pick up the call instead. Then he turned and asked his watch commander to pull out all the standardized search-and-rescue paperwork. He was steeling himself, resummoning his professionalism. “I guess we’re doing this,” he said.\r\n",
      "Roberts was the crew member on the Mustang with the most current medical training; he would complete his E.M.T. certification the following month. As he started firing questions at Dave on the radio, he didn’t like the answers that he heard coming back: the shallowness of Jon’s breathing, the likelihood of a punctured lung. More fundamental, Roberts remembered: “Any time a tree falls on somebody, it’s not good.” He was also unsettled to learn that Dave and I both lived in New York City — a red flag, he had found, when someone winds up in trouble in the wilderness.\r\n",
      "We were 100 nautical miles from the nearest hospital; a half-day trip, even in ideal conditions. The Mustang requested that the Coast Guard Air Station in Sitka send a helicopter, but the immediate plan was for Roberts and three crewmates to peel toward shore in the ship’s Zodiac and track us down. Dave had found the flare in Jon’s emergency kit and now, at 2:20, with the Zodiac underway, the Coast Guard asked him to fire it. He was still in front of our campsite, facing the water. He’d never shot off a flare before. He aimed straight up, then watched as the bright tracer rose and arced somewhere far behind him, deep in the woods. He was uncertain whether this counted as a success. He started scanning the fog in front of him, but the Zodiac never appeared.\r\n",
      "Someone on the Mustang caught sight of the flare near the end of its arc and immediately directed the crew on the Zodiac toward it, steering them far away from Dave to the opposite side of the little peninsula we’d camped on. And yet, this was lucky: they wound up coming ashore much closer to where I was waiting in the woods with Jon. Soon, whatever poem I was reciting was interrupted by whistles blowing and voices calling, and eventually three shapes, wearing hard hats and heavy orange rain gear, rushed toward us out of the trees.\r\n",
      "Roberts was especially impressive, a reassuringly large Boston-area native with a booming voice. He knelt and took Jon’s vitals. The information was troubling: his pulse was 60 beats per minute; his breathing, fast and shallow. They put his neck in a brace and eased him onto a kind of truncated backboard, called a Miller board, to move him out to the beach. Dave had returned by then. He and I crouched at one end of the board, near Jon’s feet, as someone — presumably Roberts — bellowed a count of three to lift.\r\n",
      "Later that night, lying down to sleep in a bed-and-breakfast in Gustavus — stunned and depleted, but dry and warm — Dave and I would talk and talk, reviewing the entire ordeal. We had drooped into a long silence, coasting toward sleep, when Dave spoke up with one last observation. When we were getting ready to lift Jon on the backboard, he said, it occurred to him that this was one of those crisis moments you hear about, like when mothers are suddenly able to lift a car off their baby. Dave expected we were going to have superhuman strength.\r\n",
      "We did not have superhuman strength. On Roberts’s command, the men raised Jon to waist height, swiftly and seemingly perfectly level, as though their arms and deltoids were hydraulic. Then, in one motion, they took off downhill, with negligible help from us. This can’t be accurate, but I remember the sensation of being almost dragged, like children in a sled.\r\n",
      "A National Geographic television crew was embedded at the Coast Guard’s air station in Sitka, filming an installment of a thrill-ride reality series. The network had sent crews to other Coast Guard stations around the country too, though this assignment appeared to hold the most dramatic potential. Air Station Sitka was unique: Its pilots were responsible for 12,000 miles of coastline, a sprawling, treacherous wilderness riven with fjords, inlets and glaciers, often buffeted by implacably horrible weather. People who went into the backcountry in Alaska had a way of getting themselves into a different magnitude of trouble, too; as Roberts put it, “When stuff happens in Alaska, it’s big.” Still, this was the television crew’s eighth day in Sitka, and as the show’s producer, Annabelle Hester, explained: “I was having calls with my bosses at headquarters saying, ‘Nothing is happening!’ We were scrambling to come up with Plan B.” Then, the Mustang’s call came in at 1:42.\r\n",
      "“What type of injuries are we looking at?” asked the dispatcher. She was taking the call from behind a semicircular counter, like the reception desk at a midlevel corporate branch office. She had a framed snapshot of a parakeet to brighten her work space, and a photograph of a dog with a heart that said, “I Woof You.” A cameraman stood conspicuously beside her, holding a tense, tight shot.\r\n",
      "“Probable broken ribs, a definite broken arm,” said the man on the other end. Then his voice faltered, seemed to give up: “And whatever else would happen to you if a tree fell on you,” he added.\r\n",
      "The dispatcher retrieved the appropriate paperwork and scribbled “Tree fell on person” on one line. She read the current weather aloud: “30 knots wind, 300 ceiling, heavy rain and one-mile vis.” That would soon be revised: the ceiling had dropped to 100 feet. Entering the weather conditions on one of the Coast Guard incident reports, someone would write, in a kind of nihilistic catchall: “Extremely terrible.”\r\n",
      "The Coast Guard’s policy was to deploy a helicopter within 30 minutes of the initial request, but the Air Station’s operations officer, Cmdr. Karl Baldessari, informed everyone that this mission would take longer to plan. Baldessari was a 25-year veteran of the Coast Guard, a fast-moving, sinewy man in a blousy flight suit, with a tidy mustache and spiky hair. His role at the air station was that of a firehouse chief. He was responsible for the safety of everyone working there, which meant making judicious decisions about what warranted sending them hurtling through the sky.\r\n",
      "That calculus got knotty in conditions like these, though there was a baseline volatility to flying in Alaska at all. The Coast Guard didn’t let its helicopter pilots fly lead out of Sitka, no matter how much experience they had at other air stations, until they practiced difficult landings at specific locations in the region and got their egos battered a little by logging a full winter in the state. Visibility in Alaska was frequently poor; conditions changed quickly. One pilot told me about blindly tunneling through fog in the dark when his co-pilot got “caged”: The man lifted his eyes momentarily from his instruments and, without any visual references or a horizon to latch onto, found it impossible to reorient himself, lost all sense of direction and was felled by vertigo.\r\n",
      "During much of the year it was also cold enough, with sufficient moisture in the air, that ascending to clear the region’s many minor mountains or even just flying through a cloud risked the aircraft’s icing up. To mitigate this, the Coast Guard had laid out virtual “track lines” across the entirety of their range: a grid of GPS points and a network of paths connecting them, along which pilots could chart a course and fly at a relatively low altitude, confident they weren’t going to smash into a mountain. The system wasn’t comprehensive; the track lines got the pilots close to their destination, but ultimately they had to diverge from this GPS superhighway and fly the remaining distance the old-fashioned way, with their radar and eyes. It was like taking an exit off the interstate, except there might be a granite wall in front of you wherever you chose to get off. It was possible the pilots would travel very far — a half-mile away from whoever needed their help — only to discover that the last leg was too risky and be forced to turn back.\r\n",
      "Baldessari gathered the two pilots on duty that afternoon and the Air Station’s flight surgeon, then unrolled a large paper map. He pointed to our location, explaining: “That’s probably one of the lousiest places we fly in and out of. This Inian Pass, right here, is the worst place we could possibly go.”\r\n",
      "Inian Pass is a slim channel near the center of the Icy Strait, the long, interconnected system of waterways stretching through Glacier Bay. Conditions in the Icy Strait can be bad 300 days of the year, Baldessari recently told me; wind, rain and storm surges all push through it fast from the open ocean. But Inian Pass is a narrow keyhole at the center of the strait — a mile-wide opening between a few uninhabited islands and a rocky point — where all that weather speeds up. The only way for the pilots to reach us would be to fly straight through it.\r\n",
      "Nothing in the National Geographic footage, at this point, feels reassuring. The flight surgeon holds his hand over his mouth and bites his lip. The co-pilot, Chris Ferguson, only a few months into his posting in Alaska, mills around and fidgets with his ear. It’s obvious Baldessari needs convincing. He wasn’t eager to send his men up if he didn’t have to and wasn’t certain they would make it all the way there if he did.\r\n",
      "“It’s kind of funny,” he told the pilots, pointing at the map. “You’ve got a boat right here.”\r\n",
      "Lying on his backboard like a burl of driftwood, Jon was conscious and cognizant of his pain, but he had started to feel somehow buffered from his body, uninterested in connecting with the world beyond it. He would later describe himself as a “thinking blob. It was a very passive experience.” He didn’t know what was happening but could tell our momentum had stalled. He was confused and felt impatient. In his mind, the three of us had solved the impossible problem: We’d managed to get help. This was supposed to be the simple part, when everyone rushed him to the hospital. Instead, his condition deteriorated. Within 10 minutes of reaching the beach, Jon threw up. I’d never seen anything like it, a kind of dark purple gristle. I took out my wool cap to wipe his face, and he retched a second time, straight into my hat.\r\n",
      "“I got that all over me,” John Roberts told me recently. He’d seen vomit like that before; it meant Jon had ingested a fair amount of blood and signaled internal injuries. It made Roberts anxious. He had been on the Mustang for two and a half years at that point but had spent the previous four years in Palm Beach, a busy but less extreme posting that often involved rescuing weekend boaters from relatively close to shore — and where, Roberts pointed out, the water is warm and won’t necessarily kill you if you go in. Moreover, the bulk of the Coast Guard’s training is for maritime rescues, not rescues on land. Counterintuitive as it sounds, Roberts’s comfort level and confidence had dropped significantly once he hopped off the Zodiac and set foot on the beach.\r\n",
      "He reported back to the Mustang that Jon had thrown up, then soon radioed again, explaining that Jon was going into shock. He kept giving and requesting updates, trying to gauge how long this might take, and eventually started erecting a makeshift shelter out of plastic sheeting and medical tape, hoping to keep Jon out of the rain. Out of earshot of us, Roberts explained to his crew mate Eamon McCormack what the vomit meant: The possibility of Jon dying, here under their care, was real. At one point in the National Geographic footage, as Roberts’s calls are relayed to the air station in Sitka, you can see where the dispatcher clearly writes on her form: “E.M.T. does not feel comfortable.”\r\n",
      "By this time, the air station’s flight surgeon had received enough information to be alarmed. “It sounds like he’s got a pretty significant chest injury,” he told Baldessari. Baldessari understood they would need to launch a helicopter but warned the Mustang that the aircraft might not make it through the weather; ultimately it would be the pilots’ call, once they veered off their last track line and tried to shoot through Inian Pass.\r\n",
      "They would go and give it a look, Baldessari explained over the radio, but the outlook was iffy. The guys on the beach, he said, must be prepared to get Jon back on their cutter and haul him to a hospital themselves, as fast as they could.\r\n",
      "One evening this winter, my phone rang, and it was Karl Baldessari. Long retired from the Coast Guard, he was teaching aviation at a community college in Oregon, where I left a voice mail message earlier that day. I meanwhile had metamorphosed into a 40-year-old father of two and fumbled to explain to Baldessari that, as thrilled as I was to have tracked him down, I was, at the moment, racing to finish a risotto for my daughters before gymnastics practice and would have to call him back. Without missing a beat, Baldessari blared orders at me, joking, but still sounding as instinctually in charge as he did in the National Geographic footage: “O.K.,” he said, “you want to stir it constantly, but slowly!”\r\n",
      "I didn’t expect any of the Coast Guardsmen I was cold-calling to remember that day. However dramatic it remained for me, I assumed it would have been obscured in a yearslong wash of more sensational incidents. But everyone I spoke to did remember it, immediately and in detail. Baldessari had been involved in hundreds of rescue operations during his 30-year career, and yet, as I stood at the stove on the phone that evening, he told me: “The moment I listened to your voice mail, I knew exactly the case! It was almost like it was yesterday.”\r\n",
      "There was something about the supreme freakishness of the accident that left a lasting impression. For those who came ashore, the experience was also marked by a feeling of subtly escalating chaos and the pressure to surmount it. McCormack told me that ours was a story he retold endlessly, often to the younger Coast Guardsmen he was eventually tasked with training. In it was a lesson about “not taking situations that look impossible at face value,” he said. “When things start to go wrong, don’t panic or lose sight of what resources you’ve got.” Keep working the problem until its absolute end — even, McCormack added, if it means deviating from official policy.\r\n",
      "McCormack was not supposed to be landing an inflatable boat on an unforgivably rocky Alaskan shoreline, for example. But there he was, anyway, beaching the Zodiac as gingerly as he could, so that Roberts and the other men could load Jon aboard. They slid him in on his side “like a folder into a filing cabinet,” as Jon put it, and started motoring through the chop, very cautiously, back to the Mustang, about a mile away.\r\n",
      "As relieved as Jon had been when the Coast Guard first arrived, he also felt instantaneously more vulnerable. Strapped to the back board, his neck in the collar, he surrendered control of his body, however imperfect that control had been. He was being hauled around as an object now, with no ability to wriggle or shift positions, to manage his pain or even to turn his head and see what was happening. He was helpless, entirely dependent on the upright people operating around him, those voices he could hear discussing him on the far side of some gauzy divide. About 10 minutes into the trip on the Zodiac, Jon heard one of those voices say, “Oh, shit, we’re losing air.”\r\n",
      "A section of the Zodiac’s sponson — the inflatable fender that wraps around the boat — had punctured. One side was completely deflated. “It’s a big deal,” McCormack recently explained to me, sounding surprised that I had to ask. The sponson increases the boat’s buoyancy and stability, as well as keeping water from cresting over the side; under normal conditions, a Zodiac with a broken sponson would have been taken out of service automatically. Instead, McCormack found the puncture and wedged the nozzle of a small pump inside. Then — steering the boat with one hand, operating the throttle with the other — he started working the pump with his foot, essentially doing leg presses, to keep the fender partly inflated. The ride was already bumpy in four-foot seas. Now McCormack began tracing a slow, zigzagging course, doing what he could to tamp down the turbulence and the violence to Jon’s spine, as well as to guard against the possibility of the injured man’s suddenly bounding over the side on his backboard.\r\n",
      "Roberts and the other Coast Guardsmen on the Zodiac leaned over Jon to shield him from the splash. The pain was heinous; Jon seemed to be passing out. Roberts talked to him, held his hand. Roberts felt crushed, he told me; he was torturing this guy in order to save him. When they finally reached the Mustang, rather than hoist Jon off the Zodiac, they swung the ship’s crane around and simply lifted the entire boat out of the water, level with the deck, and then carried him aboard, to keep from joggling him any more.\r\n",
      "McCormack eventually returned for me and Dave, and a half-hour later we were reunited with Jon in the Mustang’s athwartship passageway, a cramped, steel hallway, like the space between two cars of a train. Jon was still battened to the backboard, wedged up to keep the weight of his body on his less-painful side. They had cut off his clothes, though he’d murmured a plea not to — he was wearing a brand-new Patagonia jacket that he had borrowed from a friend — then swaddled him in a hypothermia blanket. Dave and I knelt and rubbed his feet.\r\n",
      "The helicopter was going to make it. I don’t remember there being a grand announcement. I’m not sure we were ever made aware of the possibility that it wouldn’t. Now the crew got busy below: tying down anything that could be blown off by the rotor wash or stashing it in the mess. I also don’t remember hearing the helicopter when it finally arrived. Instead, I remember only a heavy door to our left swinging open to reveal, like a scene from an action movie, the silhouette of a man in a blue flight suit, feet planted shoulder-width apart to steady himself as the ship rocked sideways. The cable he’d been lowered on drew back into the ocean spray and fog behind him. “I’m flight surgeon Russ Bowman,” he said and stepped inside.\r\n",
      "Bowman took Jon’s vitals and gave him several, successive shots of morphine. Soon, everyone was working to squeeze him back through the narrow doorway and onto the deck where the helicopter, an MH-60 Jayhawk, was idling overhead.\r\n",
      "Until recently, the story I told about the accident unfolded in two basic acts: the tree fell, instantaneously unleashing a kind of unfathomable chaos; then the Coast Guard appeared and, just as swiftly, regathered that chaos into order. It was like watching footage of an exploding object, then watching it run in reverse. The maneuver the Coast Guard was readying to execute now, on the deck of the Mustang, would be the climax of that progression.\r\n",
      "The helicopter hovered 30 or 40 feet over the boat, mirroring its speed and trajectory, while both vehicles moved slowly forward. “Looks like you’re heading for a rain squall,” the co-pilot, Chris Ferguson, radioed the Mustang at one point, and asked the ship to adjust its course, to keep them in as forgiving weather as possible. Soon the flight mechanic was calling out instructions to tuck the aircraft into alignment: “Forward and right 30. Forward and right 20. Forward and right 10.” Then, finally — speaking, in the flight recordings, with an almost galling air of imperturbability — the lead helicopter pilot, Rich McIntyre, radioed the flight mechanic to begin the hoist.\r\n",
      "The whole procedure, from our vantage point, seemed seamless and routine. In a way, it was: After the agonized deliberation at the air station, the pilots exited off their GPS route into fairly manageable conditions around Inian Pass. The winds were workable; the water wasn’t excessively choppy. Ultimately, scooping Jon off the deck of the Mustang would resemble a standard exercise that the pilots drilled in their trainings. “Not to dumb it down,” the co-pilot, Chris Ferguson, told me — plucking someone with a spinal injury off a moving boat and hoisting them into a moving helicopter is a pretty insane thing to do. “But we normalize what isn’t normal.”\r\n",
      "A few moments earlier, as the men scurried around Jon on his backboard, packaging and fastening him for the hoist, Jon worried that the second he got airborne he would start twirling uncontrollably, like the feathery end of a cat toy, and potentially thwack his head on the equipment on deck. But now, he was levitating smoothly — a solitary, swaddled bale of a man, perfectly perpendicular to the ground. Dave and I watched it happen: our friend rising steadily away from us, improbably, to safety. As Jon floated higher, he could hear the Coast Guardsmen on the Mustang beneath him begin to cheer. He felt it was safe to open his eyes. When he did, he saw someone, hunched in the open cargo door of the helicopter, pointing a television camera at him.\r\n",
      "Video Clip From National Geographic Image Collection\r\n",
      "Jon was rushed into surgery at the hospital in Sitka that evening. He’d punctured both lungs, one to the point of collapse, sustained multiple fractures on eight of his ribs, broken several vertebrae, shattered his left shoulder blade and snapped his brachial plexus nerves. His spleen had been macerated into countless flecks. After awakening from surgery, Jon was disappointed that the doctors had swept those shards into a bag and thrown his spleen in the trash; he wanted to get a look at it, maybe even keep it preserved in a jar, alongside his cyborg-banana.\r\n",
      "Once back in Gustavus, Dave and I realized that we would need to call Jon’s parents in Switzerland. I didn’t have to push the job on Dave this time; he was adamant. He felt he would need to face conversations like these if he was going to be a doctor. It was Jon’s father who picked up, and after absorbing the news, he paused and caught Dave off guard. “Thank you,” he said solemnly. “You guys saved my son’s life.”\r\n",
      "Dave’s stomach dropped. “I remember thinking about it,” he told me recently, “and realizing, Yeah. I guess, logistically, we did.” I had the same reaction when Dave hung up the phone and, clearly shaken, relayed his conversation to me. Until that moment, the idea that we saved Jon’s life had never occurred to us, possibly because the idea that Jon might have died still hadn’t occurred to us. We had zero sense of accomplishment, or even agency. In our minds, all we did was avoid screwing up until the real help could arrive and save him.\r\n",
      "But Jon hadn’t absorbed the story that way. From the instant he willed himself out of the water, he felt all of us locking into that same seamless flow of order steadily displacing chaos that Dave and I only experienced once the Coast Guard arrived. It was amazing to him how the three of us managed to generate solutions for each successive problem. Even my reciting those poems, which to me had always felt like a moment of utter helplessness, became, in Jon’s telling, a perfect emblem of that streak of serendipitous problem-solving. “You conveyed a calmness,” he told me recently. “I remember it being this nice moment.” He added that if he ever has to spend two hours dying on a remote forest floor again, having me there to recite poetry would be one of his top ways to do it.\r\n",
      "The feeling of inevitability that day became only more pronounced for Jon as time passed and the entire story of our rescue receded into a prologue to the rest of his life. The surgery in Sitka was only the first of half a dozen, and it would take several years for him to regain 60 percent of the use of his arm, wrist and hand, as the nerves gradually regrew along his injured side. He was in good enough shape to go back to Alaska the summer after the accident — repairing boats in the company’s warehouse and occasionally helping out at the bed-and-breakfast — but he struggled. He could repair kayaks but needed help lifting them. He was unable to wrestle the mattress corners into the fitted sheets when he made the beds. After that, he started working at a recording studio in Portland, just as he envisioned while stuck in the water, and he now runs his own audio-mastering company: Spleenless Mastering.\r\n",
      "Eventually Jon seemed to have recovered from the accident without any conspicuous disabilities. But his life has been quietly corroded by chronic pain and, almost equally, by the stresses of navigating the doctors, medications (and their side effects) to manage it. About two years after the accident, he learned he had PTSD. The trauma wasn’t the falling tree, but his experience of powerlessness as a perpetual patient in the American medical system. It manifested as a kind of unbearable empathy for anyone who was suffering. Jon found himself shouting at doctors, on his own behalf but also on behalf of strangers in waiting rooms who weren’t being seen. He would hear interviews with natural-disaster victims or the homeless on NPR and have to pull his car over. There continued to be other tribulations, too — more mundane ones. A few times a year, he still rebreaks a rib out of nowhere; once or twice, Jon told me, all it has taken is an especially affectionate hug from his wife.\r\n",
      "Jon found early on that he could cordon off this suffering, both in his own mind and in conversation, by making jokes about the accident itself and sticking to the happy ending of our rescue, a trick that got much easier after the National Geographic show aired later that year. “Mission Rescue: Final Frontier,” the program was called. The soundtrack was all heart-thwacking synth drums and shredding guitar. A foreboding, Ken Burns-effected snapshot of Dave and Jon looking joyful before the trip gave way to a whirring re-enactment of someone else’s legs — cast in the role of Dave’s legs — sprinting through the blurry woods for our radio. A melodramatic narrator pondered the fate of “Kayaker Jon Cohrs.”\r\n",
      "Initially, the schlockiness of the production felt like a blessing. The show depersonalized the accident, giving us all a shorthand to convey how dramatic that day had been, without confronting how destabilizing and senseless it might have felt. At a party, you could lay out the basics — a tree fell on Jon — then say, “National Geographic even made a TV special about it,” and everyone would go wide-eyed but then move on, figuring you would unspool the real story some other time.\r\n",
      "But we never realized the degree to which that kitschy shorthand started to obscure the real story — then, gradually, to replace it. I’m embarrassed to admit that, though Jon and I have remained close, I did not know the extent to which he has continued to suffer for the last 17 years until talking to him for several hours in order to write this account.\r\n",
      "The morning after the accident, Dave and I traveled back to Dundas Bay to pack up our campsite and collect the kayaks we abandoned the previous evening. We were shuttled there from Gustavus by the same boat captain who dropped us off three days earlier, a forbiddingly taciturn commercial fisherman named Doug Ogilvy.\r\n",
      "The tide in the cove was way out when we arrived; it was, as Ogilvy put it, “a suck-ass beach.” The approach was so shallow that he had to drop anchor a hundred yards or more from shore. He asked if we had waders. We did not. So Ogilvy put on his, climbed down the ladder and told Dave to get on his back. Then stoically, like an ox or an old-timey strongman hauling a safe, he trudged through the thigh-high water, dropped Dave on the gravel beach, then lurched back and hauled me the same way, as if I were a man-size infant in a papoose.\r\n",
      "Dave told me he’d had a strange feeling on the ride out, as if we would discover that an even more massive tree had fallen on our tent since we last slept there and that all three of us would have been crushed and killed if we’d spent another night in Dundas Bay, as planned. That is, he half-expected to find evidence that the accident had been fortuitous somehow, that there was a reason, or redemptive value, behind it. My mother had the same instinct when I called her the night before. On the phone I strained to emphasize for her — she was only two years into her cruelly premature widowhood, and I was new at being the overprotective son of a widow — that Jon was going to be all right, and that Dave and I were safe. She told me that my dad must have been up there looking out for us somehow.\r\n",
      "I resented all the supernatural thinking. If it comforted other people, fine, but I’d somehow known right away that I didn’t need a reason for the accident. It was senseless, but straightforward, as unequivocal a fact as my father’s death had been. A tree fell in the woods. It might not have, but it did. Jon could have died, but he didn’t. Other possibilities spiraled infinitely outward from there, though apparently I wasn’t too interested in contemplating them. As strange as it sounds, it was years before I realized that the tree could have hit me — and only after a friend pointed this out, as I told the story around a fire one night. And it was only a few weeks ago, while on the phone with Jon, that it occurred to me that the tree could have hit all three of us — we were standing in a single-file line, after all, waiting to cross the creek — and that we all might have wound up clobbered and scattered in that river, dying slowly and watching each other die.\r\n",
      "It’s also probably true that I helped preclude these possibilities by being so feverishly paranoid about bears, wheeling around at the sound of the snapping roots. That’s what allowed me to see the tree coming, just barely, and scream that infinitesimal heads-up for Dave. And so, the real meaning of the accident, if I felt compelled to find one, might be that it validated my most exaggerated fears. But instead, it somehow helped cleanse me of them. There was comfort for me in accepting the arbitrariness of what happened, in regarding it as a spasm of random damage in time and space that, just as randomly, a small number of human beings got the opportunity to repair. We were more capable than I had understood. We were also far more helpless.\r\n",
      "On the ride back to Gustavus with our gear, I pictured myself, again, as a small blip in empty space. The ride was rough and jumpy as Ogilvy impatiently pounded his boat through the last vestigial wave energy of the storm; Dave and I had to hold on, to plant ourselves on the bench behind him. But there was a moment when I felt so safe that I loosened my grip, leaned slightly into the motion of the boat, and, closing my eyes, felt myself lift off the seat.\r\n",

Yoshitaka Sakurada says he submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He said he made comments that hurt the feelings those in the disaster-hit areas.\r\n",
      "By MARI YAMAGUCHI\r\n",
      "Associated Press\r\n",
      "TOKYO (AP) Japan's Olympic minister resigned Wednesday after making remarks deemed offensive to the people affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, a gaffe that had questioned his credentials.\r\n",
      "Yoshitaka Sakurada said he submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He said he made comments that hurt the feelings those in the disaster-hit areas, and just retracting them would not be enough.\r\n",
      "Sakurada, at a party earlier Wednesday for Hinako Takahashi a ruling lawmaker from Iwate, one of the prefectures severely hit by the disaster said Takahashi is more important than reconstruction.\r\n",
      "Sakurada was in charge of the 2020 Games, whose main theme is to promote reconstruction of the disaster-struck region.\r\n",
      "Abe was quick in his damage control. Soon after accepting Sakurada's resignation, he apologized for the minister's remark to the people in the disaster-hit region, reassuring them that his government has an unshakable policy to do the utmost for reconstruction while staying close to the feelings of the people affected.\r\n",
      "\"As prime minister, I offer an apology to everyone in the disaster-hit areas,\" Abe said. \"I have a responsibility for having appointed him.\"\r\n",
      "Former Olympic minister Shunichi Suzuki is expected to return to the post to replace Sakrada, Japanese media reports said.\r\n",
      "Sakurada joined Abe's Cabinet as part of its reshuffle last year, quickly making a reputation as a gaffe-prone minister.\r\n",
      "Sakurada, who also doubled as cybersecurity strategy chief, said in November that he does not use a computer. In February, he was forced to apologize after expressing disappointment over swimming gold medal hopeful Rikako Ikee's disclosure of her leukemia diagnosis. Sakurada was also scolded for being late and holding up a parliamentary session.\r\n",
      "\"Minister Sakurada's resignation is only natural. It was an unbelievable comment that hurt the feelings of the people in the region and others working hard for the reconstruction,\" said Yukio Edano, leader of a main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan.\r\n",
      "Edano also criticized Abe for repeatedly defending Sakurada despite his repeated problems since his appointment.\r\n",
      "Sakurada's resignation is also an embarrassment for Abe, who saw another Cabinet member step down over a questionable remark. Deputy minister of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism minister Ichiro Tsukada quit last week after suggesting he acted for the interests of Abe and Finance Minister Taro Aso over a road project related to their constituencies, prompting opposition lawmakers to seek explanation though he denied any preferential treatment.\r\n",

      "Title:  338 These popular tax deductions still worth claiming\n",
      "Content:  338 Among the many changes the 2017 tax law enacted are new limits on previously deductible items. But filers who typically itemized deductions in the past can still take some popular items as deductions on their  2018 tax return. If they total more than your standard deduction, you can cut your tax bill or increase your refund. Here are some that are still claimable:\r\n",
      "Medical and dental expenses\r\n",
      "This includes your unreimbursed expenses for medical and dental services and related equipment. It also includes the miles you drive to and from medical care at a rate of 18 cents per mile. \r\n",
      "For taxpayers who expect to have a considerable amount of out-of-pocket medical expenses, this is a potentially valuable tax-saving opportunity. That's because taxpayers who itemize can deduct qualifying medical expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of their adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2018. In 2019, the income threshold will return to 10 percent.\r\n",
      "How to navigate 2019's messy tax season\r\n",
      "Taxes you paid\r\n",
      "There was a big change to a popular deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, which had been widely claimed by those reside in high-tax states. This deduction includes a range of taxes including income, real estate and sales tax. Although SALT can still be claimed, it will benefit fewer taxpayers in 2018 because the new tax law capped the deduction at a maximum of $10,000. \r\n",
      "The rule still says you must choose between deducting sales or income tax but not both. Also, taxes paid on property owned outside the U.S. are no longer deductible. \r\n",
      "Home mortgage interest \r\n",
      "The deduction for interest you paid on loans secured by your home can still be claimed for 2018. In some cases, this deduction may now be limited, but most taxpayers won't be affected by the new limits. In the past, you could deduct interest on mortgage loans of up to $1 million, if the mortgage was used to acquire a first or second residence. You could also deduct interest on home equity loans of up to $100,000. \r\n",
      "The new law caps the limits on new loans used to buy a house to a total of $750,000, and it no longer allows the deduction for interest on new home equity loans (unless used for home improvements). \r\n",
      "Many homeowners with mortgages and home equity loans taken out before 2018 won't be affected because the old tax rules are still in place for them. Also, since the new limits don't affect homeowners who take out a new mortgage of less than $750,000, not much changes here for most filers.   \r\n",
      "Gifts to charity\r\n",
      "The deduction for donations to charity was preserved, with a few changes. The AGI limitation on cash donations to qualified charities was expanded from 50 percent to 60 percent, so even larger donations will be deductible. \r\n",
      "But if you donated to a college and received tickets to an athletic event, you're now required to reduce the amount of your charitable donation deduction by the value of any tickets you receive. Surprisingly, this reduction wasn't required in prior years. \r\n",

      "Content:  339 In our Pushing the Limits series, we look how the U.S. Marine Corps is preparing for modern warfare using some of the same tools and technology the enemy does – tools you can buy online and rig up in the field.\r\n",
      "Alexandria, Va. -- It's not the theater of war the Marines expect to fight in, but the so-called sumo robot competition is training them to confront a modern enemy. At innovation boot camp, a five-day, hands-on training course, Marines learn how to use the latest in cheap but effective technology. Veteran Brad Halsey created the program, Building Momentum.\r\n",
      "CBS News\r\n",
      "\"The Marine Corps is amazing in the fact that they are very adept at solving problems on the battlefield with whatever they have. And so why not equip them with today's technologies?\" Halsey said. \r\n",
      " They include technologies like welding, laser cutting, and 3D printing. The goal? Empower Marines in the field to solve their own problems. A graduate 3D-printed a wrench that would have taken six months to replace. \r\n",
      " \"So he uses a CAD program, CADed it up, did a couple iterations, printed it, and then it totally worked,\" Halsey said.\r\n",
      " Marines also learn basic coding with kits you can buy for less than $100. \"This is a Arduino robot. Arduino is just a basic design program, software design for guys like me who aren't big game,\" Staff Sgt. John Sedlacek described. He's an explosive ordnance disposal technician.\r\n",
      "\"Say, okay, I've got a little tiny room to get into. I just need to peek in there. Okay, well, if I have an Arduino kit… I can do that on my own, program it right there, exactly what I need for that situation,\" Sedlacek said.\r\n",
      "It allows them to be more efficient and execute things on the fly.\r\n",
      "\"The battle field is moving towards electronic warfare… Not knowing this is going to put you behind – behind the enemy,\" Sedlacek said. \r\n",
      " Terrorist groups like ISIS have weaponized basic drones, even used them to drop small bombs. The Marines are learning how to modify commercial, off-the-shelf drones to level the battlefield. \r\n",
      " \"Improvise, adapt and overcome,\" Sgt. David Ramirez said, referring to a Marine slogan. \"And this is definitely just us doing what we do best.\" \r\n",
      " For the final challenge of the week, the Marines are given a simulated disaster relief mission. They'll need to find solutions using the technology they've learned.\r\n",
      " \"Everyone, the earthquake has hit. You now have to drive your robot into the room, assess where the four bodies are. After you find all four of them, your drone operators will step in and deliver them their supplies,\" Cheyanne Dwyer of Building Momentum said. \r\n",
      " One team hits a road bump. A camera they've trained to survey the room goes down. \r\n",
      " \"Things go wrong. How do you react to it? What did you learn this week that you can apply to it on the spot, in the moment, in a high stress situation? This is the most important part of this training right here,\" said Capt. Matthew Audette of Marine Corps systems command.  \r\n",
      " \"People call this Marine MacGyvers?\" Crawford said. \r\n",
      " \"That's exactly it. It's – it is Marine MacGyver training,\" Audette said. \"Using circuitry, microcontrollers, 3D printing, computer aided design.\"\r\n",
      "It's the future of warfare. \r\n",
      " \"We are looking for platoons of Marine MacGyvers,\" Audette said.\r\n",
      "Halsey and his team are rolling out this program around the world. They've already set up a technology center at a Marine base in Kuwait. Right after our visit, the team flew to Okinawa, Japan to run two weeks of innovation boot camps there.\n",

      "BOSTON A member of the family that owns OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma told people at the prescription opioid painkiller's launch party in the 1990s that it would be \"followed by a blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition,\" according to court documents filed Tuesday.\r\n",
      "The details were made public in a case brought by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey that accuses Purdue Pharma, its executives and members of the Sackler family of deceiving patients and doctors about the risks of opioids and pushing prescribers to keep patients on the drug longer. The documents provide information about former Purdue Pharma President Richard Sackler's role in overseeing sales of OxyContin that hasn't been public before.\r\n",
      "The drug and the closely held Connecticut company that sells it are at the center of a lawsuit in Massachusetts and hundreds of others across the country in which government entities are trying to find the drug industry responsible for an opioid crisis that killed 72,000 Americans in 2017. The Massachusetts litigation is separate from some 1,500 federal lawsuits filed by governments being overseen by a judge in Cleveland.\r\n",
      "But the company documents at the heart of the Massachusetts allegations are also part of the evidence exchanged in those cases. While the Massachusetts filing describes their contents, the documents themselves have not been made public, at the company's request.\r\n",
      "According to the filing, Richard Sackler, then senior vice president responsible for sales, told the audience at the launch party to imagine a series of natural disasters: an earthquake, volcanic eruption, hurricane and blizzard.\r\n",
      "\"The launch of OxyContin Tablets will be followed by a blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition. The prescription blizzard will be so deep, dense, and white,\" he said, according to the documents.\r\n",
      "\"Over the next twenty years, the Sacklers made Richard's boast come true,\" lawyers in the attorney general's office wrote. \"They created a manmade disaster. Their blizzard of dangerous prescriptions buried children and parents and grandparents across Massachusetts, and the burials continue,\" they wrote.\r\n",
      "The complaint says the Sackler family, which includes major donors to museums including the Smithsonian Institution, New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Tate Modern in London, was long aware its drug was dangerous and addictive but pushed more sales anyway.\r\n",
      "A memo among family members in 2008 warned of a \"dangerous concentration of risk\" for the family, the complaint says. Years earlier, Richard Sackler wrote in an email that the company would have to \"hammer on the abusers in every way possible,\" describing them as \"the culprits and the problem.\"\r\n",
      "Joanne Peterson, who runs a Massachusetts-based support network for the family members of people addicted to drugs, said Sackler's comments show a \"blatant disregard for human life.\"\r\n",
      "\"He certainly hammered them six feet under,\" Peterson said. \"I've been to more funerals than I can count in the last 15 years.\"\r\n",
      "Purdue Pharma accused the attorney general's office of cherry-picking from millions of emails and documents to create \"biased and inaccurate characterizations\" of the company and its executives. The company said in a statement said it will \"aggressively defend against these misleading allegations.\"\r\n",
      "The company also stresses that its drug is approved by federal regulators and prescribed by doctors; that it accounts for a small portion of opioids sold in the U.S.; and that illicit drugs including heroin and street fentanyl are causing most overdose deaths.\r\n",
      "\"In a rush to vilify a single manufacturer whose medicines represent less than two percent of opioid pain prescriptions rather than doing the hard work of trying to solve a complex public health crisis, the complaint distorts critical facts and cynically conflates prescription opioid medications with illegal heroin and fentanyl,\" Purdue Pharma said.\r\n",
      "Messages seeking comment were left with a spokeswoman for the Sackler family.\r\n",
      "Massachusetts is the first state to personally name the company's executives in a complaint. It names 16 current and former executives and board members, including CEO Craig Landau, Richard Sackler and other members of the Sackler family.\r\n",
      "A suit filed by the New York County of Suffolk also names members of the family. A lawyer who filed that suit, Paul Hanly, said he expects the family to be named in further suits.\r\n",

      "Feb. 19, 2019, 3:52 PM GMT / Source: CNBC.com\r\n",
      "A drone that can change shape in flight has been developed by researchers at the University of Zurich to assist with search and rescue missions.\r\n",
      "Able to contract and fold, the aircraft can enter small cracks and spaces to stream footage to rescue teams via its two integrated cameras. The drone is designed for use in areas in disaster zones that become inaccessible to rescuers due to safety concerns or physical restrictions.\r\n",
      "Davide Falanga, one of its developers, said the drone could make rescue missions more efficient and effective.\r\n",
      "\"(This drone could have) multiple impacts it can go into areas that would otherwise be inaccessible,\" he said. \"In the aftermath of an earthquake it could let rescuers enter and explore a collapsed building. We used the most efficient and stable systems allow it to fly longer, and have held public demonstrations in realistic scenarios which showed that this is a feasible product.\"\r\n",
      "Funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, the project took six months to go from concept to prototype. However, as the drone is still in early-development stages, its developers have no timescale for a wide rollout.\r\n",
      "\"We would be open to commercializing and discussing opportunities with investors, but at the moment there's no commercial plan,\" Falanga told CNBC. \"We have sometimes had to tinker with the system when we've deployed it we want it to be deployed and work immediately, so we need about six months to a year to improve the drone and make it more robust so it can work in more scenarios. But the idea itself is definitely feasible.\"\r\n",
      "According to the research paper written by the drone's developers, their aircraft \"could lead to a shift in the research community towards morphing aerial vehicles.\"\r\n",
      "However, they noted that there were still several unsolved research questions, such as \"automatic morphology selection,\"which refers to the robot's ability to autonomously take the best shape for the task at hand.\r\n",
      "Unsolved problems\r\n",
      "Mohan Sridharan, senior lecturer at the University of Birmingham's School of Computer Science, told CNBC via email that foldable drones were being explored by the wider robotics research community, with several concepts currently in development.\r\n",
      "\"This would indeed help in disaster response, but the stable navigation of such a drone is not a solved problem,\" he said. \"Also, complex applications such as disaster response pose other challenges related to perception, reasoning, and communication.\"\r\n",
      "Maria Kamargianni, lecturer in transport and energy at University College London, told CNBC that privacy concerns would need to be addressed before the drone could be commercialized.\r\n",
      "\"This is a very promising technology for search and rescue projects, and it's much more economically viable than existing options. In circumstances where a helicopter or a drone could be used, a drone would be much cheaper to deploy,\" she said.\r\n",
      "\"The technology has lots of other applications as well for example, it could be used to examine the quality of materials on a collapsed bridge. But technologies must be developed in line with public acceptance of them, so these drones should be designed in a way that notifies the public they are being used by the authorities this could be done by using distinctive colors.

      "Content:  358 PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - A dispute between Haiti and a U.S. energy trading firm is leading to long blackouts and fuel shortages in the Caribbean nation, feeding anger at President Jovenel Moise’s government following the collapse of a supply deal with Venezuela last year. \r\n",
      "    The capital Port-au-Prince’s fragile power grid was dealt a blow when Novum Energy Trading Corp suspended shipments in February, leaving residents without electricity for days and many gas stations with no fuel at the pumps. \r\n",
      "Novum says the government owes it $40 million in overdue payments for fuel. Haitian officials did not reply to requests for comment. \r\n",
      "The Western Hemisphere’s poorest nation, Haiti long relied on fuel shipments from nearby OPEC member Venezuela, which offered cheap financing to several Caribbean nations to buy its gasoline, diesel and other products through a program called Petrocaribe. \r\n",
      "    But the scheme fell apart last year due to economic turmoil in Venezuela, forcing Haiti - a nation of 11 million people - to return to international markets. \r\n",
      "    Novum, which has supplied Haiti with fuel for more than four years, stepped up its shipments as the Petrocaribe deal unravelled. Novum said it supplied 80 percent of Haiti’s gasoline and diesel needs last year. \r\n",
      "On Feb. 27, Novum anchored a vessel carrying 150,000 barrels of gasoline off Port-au-Prince until the payment dispute could be resolved. The cargo was equivalent to roughly half of Haiti’s monthly consumption of gasoline, according to industry experts. \r\n",
      "   After more than a month waiting, Novum on April 4 said the situation was “untenable” and sent the vessel to Jamaica to take on provisions. \r\n",
      "Youri Chevry, mayor of Port-au-Prince, a sprawling city of more than 2.6 million people, said electricity and gasoline shortages had grown worse over the past month as Haiti waited for the shipment. \r\n",
      "“It’s a very bad situation ... It has a lot of repercussions,” he said. \r\n",
      "    Chris Scott, Novum’s chief financial officer, said the vessel would not dock until the government could pay. He said Novum had taken such measures “fairly regularly” since mid-2018 as Haiti started to fall behind on payments after the Petrocaribe program collapsed. \r\n",
      "    “They need to pay in order for us to be able to discharge,” Scott said. \r\n",
      "   A government official, who asked not to be identified, said fuel distribution companies in Haiti had not paid the government for gasoline and diesel it purchased on their behalf from Novum. That in turn meant the government could not pay the U.S. company for the fuel. \r\n",
      "    The official said other companies were still supplying Haiti with fuel. He did not provide details. \r\n",
      "The scarcity of fuel and growing economic problems has put basic necessities increasingly out of reach for many Haitians, despite a $229 million loan program from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached last month. \r\n",
      "“I’m barely surviving,” said 40-year-old Amos, one of scores of hawkers selling black market gasoline on a busy street in the capital. On bad day, he earns little more than 50 cents. “It’s going to be difficult to see change in this country.” \r\n",
      "PROTESTS \r\n",
      "Protesters have for months agitated to remove Moise, a former businessman who took office in February 2017. They blame him for inflation running at around 17 percent, the depreciation of the gourde currency, and for not investigating alleged misuse of Petrocaribe funds by public officials. \r\n",
      "Between Feb. 7 and Feb. 27, the protests claimed at least 26 lives and injured more than 77 people, according to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, though the situation has calmed since then. \r\n",
      "    Moise has refused to step aside, saying in February he would not hand power to the leaders of violent protests. He pledged his government would take steps to address people’s grievances. \r\n",
      "Corruption is a perennial concern in Haiti. The nation ranked 166 from 183 countries in Transparency International’s global survey of perceptions of corruption last year - only Venezuela had a worse ranking in the Western Hemisphere. \r\n",
      "International pressure has grown for an investigation. In a March 20 letter, 104 member of the U.S. Congress asked President Donald Trump’s government to support investigations into Petrocaribe in Haiti, pointing to the alleged misuse of $2 billion in low-interest loans under the scheme. \r\n",
      "At the height of the Petrocaribe program, Venezuelan fuel covered nearly 70 percent of Haiti’s needs. Venezuela provided long-term financing for the oil on flexible terms, with a maximum 2 percent interest rate and a two-year grace period. \r\n",
      "Petrocaribe included a fund for infrastructure and social projects in member countries. \r\n",
      "By April 2018, Venezuela was no longer exporting fuel to Haiti, according to documents from Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA seen by Reuters. \r\n",
      "After the programme lapsed, Haitian energy companies lacked the hard U.S. currency to be able to buy fuel on international markets, said an executive at one firm, who asked not to be identified. \r\n",
      "Andre Michel, an opposition leader looking into the alleged corruption surrounding Petrocaribe, said it was difficult to estimate how much was stolen but the signs of misused of funds appeared compelling. \r\n",
      "    “No serious projects have been completed: no hospitals, no campus for students, no roads, no housing projects,” he said. \r\n",
      "An oft-heard lament on the streets of Port-au-Prince is that while politicians pilfer billions, Haitians go hungry. Roads in the city are potholed and the vestiges of a deadly 2010 earthquake can still be seen at practically every corner. \r\n",
      "    Destine Legagneur, a small business owner, whose shop is a stone’s throw from the presidential palace, said Haitians would be scarred by the Petrocaribe scheme for years to come. \r\n",
      "“That money is going to have to be paid to Venezuela one way or another,” he said. “If it’s not me, it’s my kids that are going to have to pay.” \r\n",

      "Title:  359 Government shutdown poses increasing risk to wider economy\n",
      "Content:  359 At this time of year, John Sprinkle and his wife would normally be planning their summer vacation. Not now. Sprinkle, a furloughed federal employee, is about to miss his second paycheck since the partial government shutdown began just before Christmas.\r\n",
      "With no end in sight to the longest shutdown in American history, Sprinkle and his family are postponing all manner of spending.\r\n",
      "\"We were thinking of getting a new computer, but that's not going to happen,\" he said. \"We're not really eating out like we normally would be. We are not going out to events like we would be.\"\r\n",
      "Multiply those decisions by 800,000 federal employees across the country and hundreds of thousands of government contractors who aren't being paid either, and the shutdown looms as an accelerating threat to the wider economy.\r\n",
      "The shutdown's biggest effect on the economy is likely to be the cutback in federal spending. But consumer spending, which is critical to growth, is another important factor.\r\n",
      "When government employees spend less, stores and restaurants that serve them suffer. So do landlords and lenders that do business with federal workers. Though spending and growth will rebound once the government reopens, most of the restaurant meals missed and hotel stays canceled will never be made up.\r\n",
      "\"Creditors and suppliers hit by the shutdown will become less patient if it drags on,\" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a research note. \"People and businesses are being hurt by the shutdown, and the pain will intensify.\"\r\n",
      "If the shutdown drags on through March, annual economic growth could fall to zero in the first three months of the year. Even if the government reopens by the end of the month, the annual pace of growth could be a meager 1.6 percent only half the pace of last quarter, said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.\r\n",
      "Kevin Hassett, a top White House economist, acknowledged in an interview on CNN that growth could be flat in the first quarter, though Hassett suggested that a \"humongous\" rebound would follow. Yet some independent economists doubt that the rebound would be enough to offset the initial damage. The economy is already bedeviled by slowing global growth, ongoing trade tensions and higher interest rates, which contributed to a plunge in home sales last month.\r\n",
      "Bernard Baumohl, chief economist at the Economic Outlook Group, suggested that once the government reopened, many households would focus on repaying credit card debt and restoring lost savings trends that would slow the rebound.\r\n",
      "For now, there are hints that the shutdown is slowing retail sales. A measure of weekly chain store sales fell 1.3 percent last week, its second straight drop. Cold weather likely contributed to the fall, said Michael Niemira, chief economist at the consulting firm Retail Economist, but the shutdown may also have contributed.\r\n",
      "It's hard to know just how much the shutdown is depressing consumer spending because the Commerce Department, which compiles and reports such data, was itself closed by the shutdown.\r\n",
      "Anecdotal evidence, though, suggests that the trend is spreading. Even federal workers with solid finances are holding back. Sprinkle, who lives in Alexandria, Virginia, knows he will eventually be paid, and his wife is still earning a paycheck. Their two children are out of the house, in college, and he knows he could borrow against his home equity if he had to.\r\n",
      "Still, \"the effect is more psychological,\" he said.\r\n",
      "The shutdown began on the day of his 20th anniversary working for the National Park Service, where he is now a historian. His Mac computer is roughly eight years old and will no longer update with the latest operating software. But he is postponing a replacement.\r\n",
      "The impact of the shutdown is evident beyond Washington. Officials in New Orleans announced Wednesday that they are waiving late fees for federal workers who have fallen behind on their property taxes.\r\n",
      "Also Wednesday, in Philadelphia, a hunger relief organization set up a market for furloughed federal workers under an Interstate 95 overpass. Stefanie Arck-Baynes, a spokeswoman for the group, Philabundance, said they had expected 150 to 300 people. But by 11 a.m., they had already served 300, and the lines were growing.\r\n",
      "The organization extended the hour-long event to meet demand. Tables were set up with lines of fresh produce, bread, milk and canned goods.\r\n",
      "It was the first time the group had offered an \"emergency food response\" in Philadelphia in its 35-year history, Arck-Baynes said.\r\n",
      "James Grant was there stocking up on fresh fruits and vegetables. At 64, he is diabetic and must take care with his diet. Grant has worked for 40 years as a maintenance engineer at Independence National Historical Park, which includes Independence Hall, the First Bank of the United States and the Liberty Bell.\r\n",
      "The shutdown, of course, also affects millions of relatives of federal workers. Grant has an adult son who is in a nursing home after becoming disabled years ago in a car accident. He said he has had to stop sending him money.\r\n",
      "In Washington, D.C., on Tuesday night, Hannah Perry was one of dozens who lined up at World Central Kitchen, which offered free food and coffee to federal workers. The kitchen is a charity headed by celebrity chef Jose Andres that began in 2010 to feed survivors of a massive earthquake in Haiti.\r\n",
      "Perry, 23, who works as a program assistant at the National Science Foundation, is struggling to pay her rent, student loans and health care bills.\r\n",
      "She has applied for unemployment benefits and shifted to a different student loan repayment plan under which she will pay $98 a month, a third less than her previous payment. But that plan required her to accept a higher interest rate that will raise the total cost of the loan, a small example of the potential lingering effects of the shutdown.\r\n",
      "What will she do if the shutdown continues for weeks on end?\r\n",
      "\"If it extends for a really long time, I have no idea,\" she said.\r\n",

      "Title:  360 Disaster aid bill faces tricky path as it heads to Senate\n",
      "Content:  360 WASHINGTON (AP) A battle over funding for Puerto Rico is complicating the path forward for a long-delayed disaster aid bill that's a top political priority for some of President Donald Trump's Republican allies as it heads to the Senate floor this week.\r\n",
      "At stake is $13.5 billion emergency relief legislation to help southern farmers, rebuild hurricane-damaged military bases, repair water systems, and assist victims of last year's California wildfires, among other purposes.\r\n",
      "The measure has wide backing from both Democrats and Republicans and is perhaps most ardently backed by Trump loyalists such as David Perdue, R-Ga., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who face potentially difficult re-election fights next year.\r\n",
      "The White House, however, isn't pleased with the bill and is particularly opposed to efforts by Democrats to make hurricane relief to Puerto Rico more generous. Senate Republicans are supporting food aid to the devastated island and are working with top Democrats like Patrick Leahy of Vermont to try to speed passage of the measure by adding additional help for Puerto Rico.\r\n",
      "The House passed a companion $14.2 billion version of the legislation in January, but it got tangled up in the politics of the partial government shutdown and Trump's demands for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\r\n",
      "The measure is especially sought by lawmakers from southern states like Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, which were hit by hurricanes Michael and Florence last year. There's money to respond to an earthquake in Alaska, California wildfires and floods in South Carolina, and for the ongoing recovery effort in Puerto Rico, which was devastated by back-to-back hurricanes in 2017.\r\n",
      "And now there's widespread flooding in Nebraska, Iowa and other Midwestern states.\r\n",
      "In an official position paper in January, the White House said the House bill was far too generous, objecting to almost $6 billion worth of the measure. But it stopped short of an outright veto threat, and GOP aides say Trump has since told Perdue that he'd sign the Senate version of the bill, which mirrors the House plan in most respects.\r\n",
      "For many lawmakers, passage is already overdue. Puerto Rico has already cut nutrition benefits by roughly 25 percent amid the funding crunch and Georgia lawmakers warn that their farmers need help in the run-up to planting season.\r\n",
      "\"We are past the time when this should have gotten done. I have spoken with the president many times about this. His commitment to our farmers is unwavering,\" Perdue said last month.\r\n",
      "Trump's commitment to aid to storm-ravaged Puerto Rico is in question, however.\r\n",
      "Last fall, Trump tweeted falsely that the government of Puerto Rico was using disaster aid funding to pay off its debt, and earlier this year Trump reportedly contemplated trying to shift some of Puerto Rico's disaster aid to address disaster in the mainland U.S.\r\n",
      "While Trump supports $600 million to maintain food stamp benefits in Puerto Rico, Capitol Hill aides say the White House is opposing more generous terms for delivery of disaster aid dollars and funding to rebuild antiquated water systems and make them more resilient to future storms.\r\n",
      "Allies of Puerto Rico say Trump treats the U.S. territory worse than states that have endured far less devastating hurricane disasters.\r\n",
      "\"These folks are living under the American flag,\" said Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y. \"They should not be treated any differently than any other American citizen.\"\r\n",
      "The Puerto Rican vote is an increasingly potent vote in Florida, an essential state to Trump's re-election bid. Freshman Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., a Trump ally, is a strong supporter of aid to the island.\r\n",
      "\"Puerto Rico's success is America's success and Puerto Rico's recovery is America's recovery,\" Scott said in his maiden Senate speech earlier this year.\r\n",
      "The measure represents leftover business from last year, but efforts to add it to a catchall spending bill fizzled last month. Advancing the measure on its own promises to be a delicate task and a test of divided government. It reconnects the main players in last month's successful negotiations on a catchall spending bill and border security measure.\r\n",
      "That success has lawmakers and staff aides cautiously confident that talks between Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and top panel Democrat Patrick Leahy of Vermont will bear fruit and that the measure could pass the chamber by the end of the week.\r\n",
      "And if the legislative planets aligned just right, supporters hope, the Democratic-controlled House could simply pass the Senate bill and immediately ship it to Trump, forgoing any need for time-consuming House-Senate conference talks.\r\n",
      "Generally, the more disaster areas that are addressed in an emergency aid bill, the easier it is to pass. That seems to be true in this case, and the legislation could be helped as well because so many Trump-friendly areas were affected.\r\n",
      "Tyndall Air Force Base on Florida's Panhandle took a direct hit from Hurricane Michael last October and Camp Lejeune in North Carolina took a big hit from Hurricane Florence. Communities in wildfire-ravaged northern California are eager for rebuilding help and thousands of homes in Alaska were damaged in last year's earthquake.\r\n",

      "Organizers marked the milestone on Tuesday, unveiling the stylized pictogram figures for next year's Tokyo Olympics. The pictogram system was first used extensively in 1964 when the Japanese capital lasted hosted the Olympics just 19 years after the end of World War II.\r\n",
      "A crude picture system was first used in the 1936 Berlin Olympics, and later in London in 1948. But the '64 Olympics originated the standardized symbols that have become familiar in every Olympics since then.\r\n",
      "Japanese athletes posed with the pictograms and their designer, Masaaki Hiromura. Organizers also toured regions that will host Olympic events, including the area north of Tokyo that was devastated by a 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and resulting damage to nearby nuclear reactors.\r\n",
      "Unlike other recent Olympics, construction projects are largely on schedule. The new Olympics stadium, the centerpiece of the games, is to be completed by the by the end of the year at a cost estimated at $1.25 billion.\r\n",
      "That's not to say these Olympics are problem free.\r\n",
      "Costs continue to rise, although local organizers and the IOC say they are cutting costs or at least slowing the rise.\r\n",
      "As an example, last month organizers said the cost of the opening and closing ceremonies had risen by 40 percent compared with the forecast in 2013 when Tokyo was awarded the games.\r\n",
      "Overall, Tokyo is spending at least $20 billion to host the Olympics. About 75 percent of this is public money, although costs are difficult to track with arguments over what are and what are not Olympic expenses. That figure is about three times larger than the bid forecast in 2013.\r\n",
      "Tsunekazu Takeda, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee and a powerful International Olympic Committee member, is also being investigated in a vote-buying scandal that may have helped Tokyo land the Olympics.\r\n",

      "Content:  363 Food is going uninspected by regulators. Time-sensitive data is going uncollected by scientists. And other federal workers are going without pay while doing critical work manning airport terminals and border crossings.\r\n",
      "While the partial government shutdowns effects reverberate throughout the federal bureaucracy, the Trump administration is actively working to ease the impact on wilderness lovers and oil drillers alike.\r\n",
      "Officials at the Interior Department have made a conscious effort to pursue two priorities President Trump has emphasized in his time in office energy exploration and access to public lands during the shutdown, according to a top department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to talk frankly.\r\n",
      "When discussing what is most critical during the shutdown, we have looked first to executive orders, those things the president has made a point of giving us guidance and direction on, and secretarial orders, the official said.\r\n",
      "The push to press ahead with as many operations as possible marks a sharp contrast with how the Interior Department, which oversees 1 in every 5 acres of U.S. land, operated during extended shutdowns under Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. The department is one of nine Cabinet-level departments hobbled by the partial government shutdown amid a standoff between congressional Democrats and Trump over border wall funding.\r\n",
      "The Trump administrations prioritization of energy exploration means the oil and gas business, one of the most heavily regulated industries in the United States, says it has yet to feel any real consequence from the shutdown.\r\n",
      "To this point, we have not seen any major effects of the shutdown on our industry, Mike Sommers, president and chief executive of the oil and gas businesss chief lobbying organization, the American Petroleum Institute, told reporters Tuesday.\r\n",
      "The departments Bureau of Land Management, for example, has accepted and published 22 new drilling permit applications in Alaska, North Dakota, New Mexico and Oklahoma between the start of the shutdown and Wednesday afternoon. Officials said they did not anticipate any delays in the processing of either permit applications or requests for inspections of drilling operations on federal land.\r\n",
      "But elsewhere the department says it is not even accepting other sorts of filings such as public-records requests from journalists, activists and other members of the public made under the Freedom of Information Act due to the shutdown.\r\n",
      "It seems that the oil companies are getting services from the Department of the Interior when the public is not, said Kelly Fuller, energy and mining campaign director at the Western Watershed Project, an advocacy group.\r\n",
      "The department is also pressing ahead with its goal of preparing the Alaskan Arctic for more oil and gas drilling. The department decided to go ahead with four public listening sessions about BLMs push to define what activities can be permitted at the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska because doing so would help the scoping process move forward. The sessions, which were slated to wrap up before Interior stops accepting comments on Jan. 22, had been postponed because of the Nov. 30 earthquake that hit Alaska.\r\n",
      "The NPRA was one that jumped out as being one of those priorities, said the official, adding that only two to three employees were required to conduct the listening sessions.\r\n",
      "It remains unclear if the shutdown will stymie perhaps the top goal in Alaska for the Trump administration: opening the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. While the agency announced Wednesday that it would postpone meetings in Alaska and Washington to discuss a draft document evaluating the impact of drilling on caribou, polar bears and other animals there, it indicated the Feb. 11 deadline for public comments remained unchanged.\r\n",
      "The administration, along with Alaskas Republican delegation in Congress, wants to see sections of the refuges coastal plain leased before the end of Trumps term.\r\n",
      "[Park Service takes the 'extraordinary step' of tapping fees to keep some popular parks open during the shutdown]\r\n",
      "The Trump administration is also looking for ways to keep national parks and refuges open so as not to hurt local economies that rely on tourism.\r\n",
      "After officials announced plans earlier this week to temporarily close Californias Joshua Tree National Park on Thursday to clean bathrooms and do other maintenance work, the park said it wants to restore visitor access to the park as quickly as possible to mitigate any negative impact to the local economy.\r\n",
      "A day later, the National Park Service did just that. Using revenue from entrance fees, officials averted the scheduled closure and even said they would make some recently closed areas again accessible to park visitors.\r\n",
      "And on Tuesday, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials told employees they will bring back roughly 240 of them, for 30 days, to help operate 38 national wildlife refuges across the country.\r\n",
      "A coalition of organizations that work on park and refuge issues urged Trump in a letter Wednesday to keep areas closed. They argued keeping understaffed parks and refuges open to visitors makes them vulnerable to vandalism, habitat degradation and illegal hunting.\r\n",
      "A lot of the damages could be avoided, knock on wood, if the refuges were closed, said Geoffrey Haskett, president of the National Wildlife Refuge Association.\r\n",
      "In all of these instances the department is using unspent appropriated funds from the last fiscal year, which ensures that it does not violate the Antideficiency Act.\r\n",
      "Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Barbara Wainman said in an email that the agency is using its previously appropriated funds to resume work for the next 30 days on high-priority projects and activities in support of the services mission and on behalf of the American public. The agency is using $2 million of the $8 million remaining in its wildlife habitat and visitor services account to bring back its furloughed employees.\r\n",
      "These expenditures will meet the publics desire for access to National Wildlife Refuge lands and use taxpayer dollars in a responsible manner consistent with existing service mission and priorities, she said.\r\n",
      "The agency has halted other activities during the shutdown, such as work on listing endangered species or writing biological opinions on proposed federal projects.\r\n",
      "The decision to reopen some wildlife refuges comes as the Park Service is pressing ahead with a plan to tap entrance fees to help remove the trash and human waste that has built up in many sites, which has prompted a series of partial closures.\r\n",
      "One senior Park Service official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to avoid retaliation, said that Interior Department officials did a 180 on their approach to park site closures once it became clear that mounting human waste and other factors posed serious health risks.\r\n",
      "Week one, it was Keep it all open, this employee said. Week two or three, it was, Close what you need to close. \r\n",
      "Wild animals quickly access and spread human waste, which has prompted at least a half-dozen parks across the country to bar public access to some sites. While acting interior secretary David Bernhardt has just authorized parks that collect fees to dip into those funds to pay for maintenance operations, this official explained that it will take time to send park staffers in to clean up the human waste that has already accumulated.\r\n",
      "Its essentially hazardous material, the staffer said. Its not like you can have Boy Scouts come in and clean it up.\r\n",
      "In a sign of how closing parks remains a sensitive subject for the administration, this week the agencys acting deputy director for operations, Rick Obernesser, sent out an email telling park managers they needed to let the Washington office as early as possible when planning a closure due to the shutdown.\r\n",

      "Title:  365 Pakistani village asks: Where are bodies of militants India says it bombed?\n",
      "Content:  365 JABA, Pakistan (Reuters) - The only confirmed victim of India’s air strike against Pakistan is still unsure why he was shaken awake in the early hours of Tuesday by an explosion that rocked his mud brick house and left him with a cut above his right eye. \r\n",
      "“They say they wanted to hit some terrorists. What terrorists can you see here?” said 62-year-old Nooran Shah, a resident of Jaba village, near the northeastern town of Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. \r\n",
      "“We are here. Are we terrorists?” \r\n",
      "India says Tuesday’s raid destroyed a major training camp of Jaish-e Mohammad, a militant group that claimed responsibility for a Feb. 14 attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 40 members of a paramilitary police unit. \r\n",
      "India’s Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said the strike killed “a very large number of Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists, trainers, senior commanders, and groups of jihadis who were being trained for Fidayeen action were eliminated.” Fidayeen is a term used to describe Islamist militants on suicide missions. \r\n",
      "Another senior government official told reporters that about 300 militants had been killed. \r\n",
      "On Thursday, though, a senior defence official appeared to backtrack on the claims. Asked about how much damage the warplanes had caused, Air Vice Marshal R.G.K. Kapoor said it was “premature” to provide details about casualties. But he said the Indian armed forces had “fairly credible evidence” of the damage inflicted on the camp by the air strikes. \r\n",
      "India’s previous death toll estimates have been rubbished by Pakistan, which says the operation was a failure that saw Indian jets bomb a largely empty hillside without hurting anyone. \r\n",
      "It isn’t clear whether the discrepancy in claims will become a factor as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks a second term in India’s general election, which must be held by May. There has been little sign as yet of the opposition pushing the government and the armed forces for more evidence of the mission’s results. \r\n",
      "On the wooded slopes above Jaba, villagers pointed to four bomb craters and some splintered pine trees, but could see little other impact from the series of explosions that blasted them awake at around 3.00 a.m. \r\n",
      "“It shook everything,” said Abdur Rasheed, who drives a pickup van around the area. He said there weren’t any human casualties: “No one died. Only some pine trees died, they were cut down. A crow also died.” \r\n",
      "RELIGIOUS SCHOOL APPEARS INTACT \r\n",
      "Jaba is set in a thickly wooded area of hills and streams that opens the way to the scenic Kaghan valley, a popular holiday destination for Pakistani tourists. It is a little over 60 km (37 miles) from Abbottabad, the garrison town where Osama Bin Laden was killed by American Special Forces in 2011. \r\n",
      "Locals say 400 to 500 people live locally, scattered across hills in mudbrick homes. Reuters spoke to about 15 people, none of whom knew of any casualties apart from Nooran Shah. \r\n",
      "“I haven’t seen any dead bodies, only a local who was hurt by something or hit by some window, he was hurt,” said Abdur Rasheed, echoing numerous others. \r\n",
      "In Basic Health Unit, Jaba, the nearest hospital, Mohammad Saddique, an official who was on duty on the night of the attack, also dismissed claims of major casualties. \r\n",
      "“It is just a lie. It is rubbish,” he said. “We didn’t receive even a single injured person. Only one person got slightly hurt and he was treated there. Even he wasn’t brought here.” \r\n",
      "In Balakot, a town largely rebuilt after an earthquake in 2005, Zia Ul Haq, senior medical officer in Tehsil Headquarters Hospital said no casualties had been brought in on Tuesday. \r\n",
      "People in the area said Jaish-e Mohammad did have a presence, running not an active training camp but a madrassa, or religious school, about one km from where the bombs fell. \r\n",
      "“It is Taleem ul Quran madrassa. The kids from the village study there. There is no training,” said Nooran Shah. \r\n",
      "A sign which had been up earlier in the week identifying the madrassa’s affiliation to Jaish-e Mohammad had been removed by Thursday and soldiers prevented reporters from gaining access. \r\n",

      "But it was possible to see the structure from the back. It appeared intact, like the trees surrounding it, with no sign of any damage of the kind seen near the bomb craters. \r\n",
      "Western diplomats in Islamabad also said they did not believe the Indian air force hit a militant camp. \r\n",
      "“There was no militant training camp there. It hasn’t been there for a few years they moved it. It’s common knowledge amongst our intelligence,” said one of them. \r\n",

      "Content:  375 SEATTLE (AP) A major thoroughfare for commuters along downtown Seattle's waterfront is set to shut down for good Friday, ushering in what officials say will be one of the most painful traffic periods in the history of the booming Pacific Northwest city.\r\n",
      "The double-decker, 2.2-mile (3.5-kilometer) Alaskan Way Viaduct, which carries about 90,000 vehicles each day, will be replaced by a new four-lane tunnel.\r\n",
      "But the tunnel won't open until about three weeks after the viaduct closes as workers realign the highway into it. A mélange of other construction projects will further constrain traffic in the hilly city surrounded by water, already known for its population growth and traffic woes.\r\n",
      "Washington's transportation agency on its website has a clock counting down to the viaduct closure , which it says will be the longest major highway closure the Puget Sound region has ever seen.\r\n",
      "The weekslong period between the viaduct's closure, scheduled for 10 p.m. Friday, and the state Route 99 tunnel opening is already being dubbed the \"Seattle Squeeze,\" according to Heather Marx, director of Downtown Mobility for the Seattle Department of Transportation.\r\n",
      "\"It is dramatic. Everyone traveling in the region will be impacted,\" Marx said, referring to people going to and through the Seattle metropolitan area.\r\n",
      "City, King County and state officials have been working to mitigate the headaches sure to plague anyone caught unprepared.\r\n",
      "Seattle school bus drivers will start their days earlier, and officials are advising commuters to work from home or adjust their work hours if they can. Those who can't are being asked to walk, bike, join a carpool or use transit including buses, light rail or water taxis all to avoid driving solo into downtown during peak commute times.\r\n",
      "Tad Donaghe, of West Seattle, usually travels by bus to his downtown job at Nordstrom but has worked out an alternate route involving light rail and water taxi to avoid the anticipated crush of drivers switching to buses during the closure.\r\n",
      "\"I tried out my #Viadoom commute tonight,\" he tweeted Monday, using a popular hashtag related to the closure.\r\n",
      "Donaghe told The Associated Press that route was relatively \"lovely,\" and although it will cost more and may take longer than the 80 minutes it took Monday, his employer pays for his transit so he doesn't mind.\r\n",
      "\"No matter what, it was infinitely nicer than if I had driven home,\" Donaghe said. \"I quit driving for a commute because mass transit is infinitely less stressful.\"\r\n",
      "The growth of tech giant Amazon and a population boom has spawned an abundance of construction in the Seattle area in recent years with new housing, light rail expansion and infrastructure development already straining commuters' patience. Once the tunnel opens, removing the viaduct will take months, which will be followed by the creation of a new downtown waterfront area. Large private projects also in the city's core include the renovation of a sports arena that will host professional hockey and an addition to the Washington State Convention Center.\r\n",
      "\"We've added 85,000 new people to the county in just the last two years, so these are the kinds of public spaces and destinations and mobility we need to support our growing region,\" Meghan Shepard, with Seattle's Transportation Department, said in a city video posted on YouTube.\r\n",
      "Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan recently announced legislation that would complete funding of the new waterfront area, which includes 20 acres (8 hectares) of public spaces and an elevated pathway connecting the waterfront to the historic Pike Place Market and downtown.\r\n",
      "\"After the many years of tunnel construction, the viaduct will finally be coming down, and work on the waterfront of the future will begin,\" Durkan said in a statement.\r\n",
      "The viaduct was built in 1953 and weakened in a 2001 earthquake. While it was repaired and strengthened, the aging roadway remained vulnerable to earthquakes. City and state officials and others battled for years over how best to replace it, with the tunnel plan, now estimated at $3.3 billion, chosen by former Gov. Chris Gregoire and state lawmakers in 2009.\r\n",
      "The tunnel, designed to withstand roughly a magnitude 9 earthquake off the coast of Washington state, it is set to open three years behind schedule. Lawsuits involving Seattle Tunnel Partners, its insurance companies and the state transportation agency over delays and cost overruns are expected to play out for years.\r\n",
      "The tunnel will be free to use when it opens, with tolling starting as soon as this summer.\r\n",
      "With the viaduct closure looming, the city has staffed a transportation operations center 24/7 to observe roadways in real time and make changes that can help traffic flow more smoothly, Marx said.\r\n",
      "Traffic engineers, for example, will be able to adjust traffic signal timing and send out additional buses that will be staffed and on standby. More buses in general will be deployed, and a public water taxi service from West Seattle to downtown will run more often. Drawbridges around the city will stay closed to vessels longer.\r\n",
      "And on Interstate 5, which runs through the city, the state will convert a carpool lane to general traffic and will stage more incident-response vehicles.\r\n",
      "\"This is just going to be a time where people who have flexibility to work from home or to take the bus outside of peak times, this is when those choices are going to make a difference for other people who don't have that flexibility,\" Marx said. \"If we're all paying attention to how much space we're taking up and making those decisions ... that's what's going to see us through.\"\r\n",

      "Title:  376 Wildest dreams: Scranton kid becomes governor of Alaska\n",
      "Content:  376 SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) Alaska hooked Mike Dunleavy early in life.\r\n",
      "The nation's largest state by geography and its mostly untamed wilderness sat a whole country away from the North Scranton neighborhood where Dunleavy grew up, and deeply embedded itself in his mind as he grew to 6 feet 7 inches tall.\r\n",
      "\"I was always outside. When I lived in North Scranton, I would walk up to what they used to call Bell Mountain up there above Keyser Avenue,\" Dunleavy said. \"I'd walk all over the place. I'd spend as much time as I could out there with a bunch of our friends. I liked to go hunting, I liked to go fishing. ... As I got older, (I thought) the ultimate place in the country for wilderness is Alaska. (I) just started doing research, wanted to go. When I graduated from (College) Misericordia, I came up.\"\r\n",
      "It took about 35 years, but Dunleavy runs Alaska now. The 1979 Scranton Central High School graduate, who starred in basketball there and in college, won the Alaska governor election Nov. 6.\r\n",
      "He took the oath of office for a four-year term Dec. 3, just three days after an earthquake shook the state, known for its breathtaking, if chilly, landscape.\r\n",
      "\"Pennsylvania is a beautiful state,\" Dunleavy, 57, said. \"Alaska is a spectacular state.\"\r\n",
      "At Misericordia, friends called him \"Nature\" because of his outdoors ways. They lived in off-campus housing, and Dunleavy raised chickens, ate their eggs and hunted squirrels for food.\r\n",
      "After earning his degree in history in 1983, he headed northwest to fulfill his dream. His older brother, Francis, by then working in the timber industry in Portland, Oregon, had a friend who knew someone \"at a logging camp in southeast Alaska on Prince Wales Island,\" Dunleavy said.\r\n",
      "\"And so I took that and came up and spent some time doing that,\" Dunleavy said.\r\n",
      "He worked in the shop, helping change tires and greasing and fueling vehicles.\r\n",
      "\"I just fell in love with the place as soon as I got here,\" he said. \"I was a few credits short of my teaching certificate and went back and got those credits and came up permanently in 1984.\"\r\n",
      "He taught in western Alaska at first.\r\n",
      "\"Teaching is a form of public service. You want to help people. For me, it was a logical extension,\" Dunleavy said.\r\n",
      "He met an Inupiaq Eskimo named Rose. They married and had three daughters. In 20 years as an educator, he served as a teacher, principal and superintendent in some of the state's most isolated regions.\r\n",
      "By 2004, he was superintendent of the Northwest Arctic Borough School District, which serves about 2,200 students, much of it north of the Arctic Circle.\r\n",
      "He retired shortly after with a substantial pension and headed south. The Dunleavys settled near Wasilla, whose most famous resident is former town mayor and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 2008. Dunleavy said he used to run into her in the grocery store.\r\n",
      "In 2009, he won a three-year term on the Matanuska-Susitna School Board, a school district of about 25,000 square miles, and was later elected board president.\r\n",
      "Seeing the struggles of school districts, he kept wanting to move up into positions that held more power to fix their problems, he said. In 2012 and 2014, he won election to the state Senate. He announced his bid for governor in September 2017, dropped out for three months to correct a heart problem, then won the Republican primary by a 2-to-1 margin over the second-place finisher in a field of seven candidates. He won election by defeating the Democratic candidate, former U.S. Sen. Mark Begich.\r\n",
      "He had help from several large contributors, including his brother, Francis, who donated $400,000, according to the Anchorage newspaper.\r\n",
      "Three days before he took office, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake rattled Alaska. The aftershocks continue.\r\n",
      "\"We're going to get through this,\" he told fellow residents.\r\n",
      "Perhaps it was symbolic. One columnist has called Dunleavy the state's most conservative governor. He ran on a platform of cutting taxes and spending, and reducing the size of government. He has advocated a constitutional amendment to allow spending public money on private or religious schools, according to an account in the Anchorage Daily News. He defended it as necessary to help struggling school systems. The move failed.\r\n",
      "That might seem at odds with someone born into a Democratic family. His father, Edward, was a postal worker who, the governor said, sometimes \"rolled his eyes\" at his son's political choices. His mother, Rose, a clerk at Scranton City Hall, was a fierce union leader.\r\n",
      "He hasn't returned to Scranton since his father died in 2012. He describes his parents as pro-life, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Democrats.\r\n",
      "\"I would say my parents taught all four boys to think on your own, don't follow the herd, be an individual, and that's going to serve you well,\" the governor said. \"But from my perspective, the Republican Party mirrored my values and philosophy. I'm pretty much an individual. I don't like people telling me what to do. I don't like aspects of government telling me what to do. Do I think government is evil or bad? No, not inherently, but if it's allowed to get to a certain size and get fairly intrusive in one's life, I don't care for that.\"\r\n",

      "Trump's ardent opposition to additional Puerto Rico funding sets up a showdown with House Democrats, who insist that a $13 billion to $14 billion disaster aid package that's a top priority for southern Republicans won't advance without further aid for the island.\r\n",
      "Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said Trump told Republicans at a closed-door luncheon on Tuesday that aid for Puerto Rico \"is way out of proportion to what Texas and Florida and others have gotten.\"\r\n",
      "Trump does support $600 million to deal with a food stamp shortfall in Puerto Rico that has already meant slashed benefits, Rubio said, but opposes more generous terms for delivery of disaster aid dollars and funding to rebuild antiquated water systems and make them more resilient to future storms.\r\n",
      "The disaster aid package cleared a procedural hurdle by a 90-10 vote and is expected to pass the Senate as early as late this week, which would set up talks with the Democratic-controlled House. House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., said the House will insist on further aid for Puerto Rico or the disaster aid measure won't clear Congress.\r\n",
      "\"Nearly 3,000 American lives were lost in the historic storms that devastated Puerto Rico and destroyed its infrastructure, and the island is still struggling to recover,\" Lowey said in a joint statement with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.\r\n",
      "The measure has wide support from both Democrats and Republicans and is ardently backed by Trump loyalists such as David Perdue, R-Ga., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., whose states were slammed by hurricanes last fall. The measure has been expanded so that Midwestern states such as Iowa and Nebraska that are currently suffering from flooding are eligible for disaster help.\r\n",
      "\"Just at the time when harvesting was starting, Hurricane Michael hit and crops were completely destroyed across most of our state,\" Perdue said.\r\n",
      "The House passed a companion $14.2 billion version of the legislation in January, but it got tangled up in the politics of the partial government shutdown and Trump's demands for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\r\n",
      "The measure is especially sought by lawmakers from Southern states like Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, which were hit by hurricanes Michael and Florence last year. There's money to respond to an earthquake in Alaska, wildfires in California and floods in South Carolina and for the ongoing recovery effort in Puerto Rico, which was devastated by back-to-back hurricanes in 2017.\r\n",
      "The Trump administration has been slow to deliver the aid to Puerto Rico that Congress has already approved for the island.\r\n",
      "\"The lack of leadership and coordination, combined with delays in meeting the basic needs of the island, more than eighteen months after receiving a presidential disaster declaration, has left far too many children and elderly citizens in unhealthy and unsafe conditions, families in severely damaged homes, and communities without adequate infrastructure to sustain a decent quality of life,\" Leahy and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a letter to the White House on Tuesday.\r\n",

      "Content:  407 PALU, Indonesia Six months after Palu was ripped apart by an earthquake, tsunami and liquefying soil that sucked neighborhoods into the earth and killed thousands, a second crisis is looming as recovery efforts stumble and a city that feels ignored begs for humanitarian assistance.\r\n",
      "Thousands of people in this city on Indonesias Sulawesi island are still living in sweltering tent cities, while construction of new permanent homes has yet to start and almost a third of temporary housing is unoccupied after aid groups and authorities failed to connect the units to essential utilities.\r\n",
      "President Joko Widodo, who is seeking a second term in elections this week, and his deputy promised that financial assistance to those whose homes were destroyed or whose loved ones were killed would be rapidly distributed. But not a cent has been paid out.\r\n",
      "Its like were forgotten, said Ade Zahra, a mother of eight living in a tent city who says its a miracle her family survived when the quake turned their village to mud and engulfed their home.\r\n",
      "Weve received no more assistance in the past two months, not only the government, but also humanitarian groups and volunteers who used to provide a lot, she said.\r\n",
      "The citys struggle to recover highlights a broader problem of neglect often suffered by remote regions in Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago home to hundreds of ethnic groups. Far from the center of economic, political and cultural power in populous Java, the region around Palu has a history of sectarian conflict and perceived indifference to its plight could embolden hard-liners.\r\n",
      "City officials, meanwhile, are worried frustration among the displaced has reached a breaking point.\r\n",
      "As anger among the refugees simmers, Widodo is focused on securing his reelection. Sulawesi mostly voted for Widodo in 2014, but he risks losing ground there this time. That could be crucial if the race is tighter than polls, which are predicting a strong Widodo victory.\r\n",
      "The Sept. 28 earthquake spawned a large localized tsunami that wiped out coastal areas, while liquefaction caused by the shaking turned entire neighborhoods into rivers of sludge. The disaster killed more than 4,400 people, making it the worlds deadliest seismic event in 2018.\r\n",
      "The central government, at the time still grappling with the aftermath of deadly earthquakes on Lombok Island, appealed for international aid but didnt declare a national disaster, which wouldve opened the door wider to foreign assistance. It prohibited international aid organizations from operating on the ground.\r\n",
      "Though the tragedy is fading from the national consciousness, large parts of Palu look like they were struck only yesterday, a daily reminder to residents of the horrors they lived through.\r\n",
      "About 90% of roads have been repaired, according to Palus mayor, but the shoreline is littered in debris and hollowed out buildings that lean precariously.\r\n",
      "Waves wash inside Apung Palu Mosque, which once sat majestically on pillars in Palu Bay. People looking for valuables pick through a vast jumble of personal belongings and house debris, all thats left of once thriving communities.\r\n",
      "In Sigi district bordering Palu, several dozen white tents emblazoned with the U.N. refugee agencys logo are home to hundreds of evacuees, who look with envy and anger at temporary housing across the road some of it occupied, some empty and some still unfinished.\r\n",
      "During the day, the tents are blazing hot and at night refugees, who include a man incapacitated by a stroke and a boy with cerebral palsy, shiver.\r\n",
      "Frustrated residents recall that not long after the disaster Vice President Jusuf Kalla visited and promised theyd soon get money to help rebuild their lives. Instead things seem to be getting worse.\r\n",
      "They have clean drinking water, but a mobile kitchen provided by an aid group closed due to lack of donations. Members of some families have jobs, but others have almost nothing, their former livelihoods gone. Some beg for money.\r\n",
      "Zahra, the mother of eight, said she hopes the government finally fulfills its promise.\r\n",
      "Have mercy on us, she said.\r\n",
      "Officially, about 173,000 people were displaced by the disaster and about 20,000 are still living in tents that Palus mayor says were designed to last three months. The actual number without stable housing is much higher.\r\n",
      "At a block of eight buildings built by a charitable foundation run by Kallas business empire, a banner announced they were handed over to the city on Feb. 14. All sit empty and unconnected to utilities, the only sign of life a few cows grazing between them.\r\n",
      "Temporary housing built nearby by another organization is occupied, some by residents of a neighborhood wiped out by liquefaction.\r\n",
      "Umira, who uses a single name, wept as she recalled the ordeal her family has endured since the night they fled a sea of moving trees and houses. Eight of her relatives were killed, including her grandson.\r\n",
      "Theyve gone from sheltering in a sports stadium to fashioning their own makeshift lodging in the ruins of a house to finally being assigned to a room in a temporary housing unit.\r\n",
      "We all cried with happiness, she said of the moment two months ago when they learned they would have housing. Even my husband cried and hugged the wall of our new home.\r\n",
      "The family still gets aid, Umira said, such as staple foods and cooking oil, though its distributed without any predictable schedule.\r\n",
      "When the aid runs out they rely on income from running an on-call motorcycle taxi service.\r\n",
      "If there is a call, we can eat, she said. If not, we will only eat rice with salt.\r\n",
      "Presley Tampubolon, the head of Palus disaster agency who oversees temporary housing, said the need for accommodation has been greater than anticipated.\r\n",
      "For every house destroyed or damaged, there would often be several generations of a family living in it. He said it would be inhuman to expect such families to fit into the 3-meter-by-4-meter (10-foot-by-13-foot) rooms that have been built.\r\n",
      "He said the government and aid groups have built temporary buildings with 5,300 total rooms that can accommodate nearly 41,000 people. But about 1,600 of those rooms are empty because they werent connected to water, electricity or sanitation, he said.\r\n",
      "Hidayat, the mayor of Palu who uses a single name, said the central government has stopped building temporary homes despite the need and construction of permanent dwellings hasnt started.\r\n",
      "Compounding the problem is that the central governments social affairs and public works ministries havent released mourning allowances and funds for people to build new homes.\r\n",
      "He said hes worried anger will soon boil over.\r\n",
      "The social affairs ministrys director of social protection and disaster victims, Margo Wiyono, said the ministry has verified 1,906 of the 4,400 names of heirs who would be entitled to mourning allowances and has proposed the finance ministry pay them.\r\n",
      "He said they were still investigating the rest.\r\n",
      "We dont want the allowances worth 15 million rupiah ($1,050) per heir to fall into the hands of irresponsible people, he said.\r\n",
      "The budget director-general at the finance ministry, Askolani, said its in the process of approving money to pay the allowances. He said releasing funds for new housing is contingent on several factors, including reviewing local government data and identifying areas for new settlements that are safe from liquefaction.\r\n",
      "Hidayat isnt waiting. He said the Tzu Chi Buddhist Foundation has agreed to build 3,000 new homes in the Palu area, but he is urging organizations and local governments from around the country to build more.\r\n",
      "Our regional capabilities are very limited, he said. As the mayor, Im begging for help to many humanitarian groups and institutions.\r\n",

      "Asked Monday if Takeda should resign, Tokyo Governor Yurkio Koike told reporters: \"This is an issue for the JOC. Therefore, as the government of Tokyo, we are looking at what efforts need to be made in order to ensure the success of the games.\"\r\n",
      "Members of the JOC executive board are up for re-election this summer. There is speculation Takeda will not run, or could be replaced. French investigators believe he may have helped Tokyo win the 2020 Olympics in a vote by the International Olympic Committee.\r\n",
      "Takeda has been JOC president since 2001. He is also a powerful IOC member and the head of its marketing commission. He has not stepped aside from either position while the IOC's ethics committee investigates.\r\n",
      "A similar vote-buying scandal tarnished the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics and former IOC member Carlos Nuzman, who was also head of the Brazilian Olympic Committee.\r\n",
      "French authorities suspect that about $2 million paid by the Tokyo bid committee headed by Takeda to a Singapore consulting company, Black Tidings, found its way to some IOC members in 2013 when Tokyo won the vote over bids from Istanbul and Madrid.\r\n",
      "Takeda last month acknowledged he signed off on the payments but denied corruption allegations. An internal report in 2016 by the Japanese Olympic Committee essentially cleared Takeda of wrongdoing.\r\n",

      "Content:  413 WACO, Texas (AP) Chloe Jackson took an unusual path to being the starting point guard for top-ranked Baylor and coach Kim Mulkey.\r\n",
      "Jackson was a graduate transfer last summer after two seasons as a shooting guard at LSU. She was a standout soccer player who also loved basketball in high school, and if not for a rare earthquake affecting her home state of Maryland then, she might now be kicking balls somewhere instead running the floor for the nation's top women's basketball team.\r\n",
      "\"Chloe has been great to play with. ... Being a point guard is tough, considering I'm the third-string point guard on this team. It's good to see she can come to a new team and run a whole bunch of different plays with a whole different playing system from LSU,\" Baylor teammate DiDi Richards said. \"It's cool to see she can adapt to something so quickly.\"\r\n",
      "Big 12-leading Baylor (17-1) on Monday took over the No. 1 spot in the AP women's basketball poll for the first time since the end of the 2012-13 regular season, when the Lady Bears had All-American point guard Odyssey Sims and national player of the year Brittney Griner.\r\n",
      "When Jackson left LSU for Baylor, she was looking for the chance to win a championship and prepare herself for playing at a higher level.\r\n",
      "\"Never knew how big my role was going to be, but I knew what (Mulkey) wanted me to do, and I felt like that would better me for the next level,\" Jackson said. \"Obviously playing on the biggest stage on an elite level.\"\r\n",
      "Her anticipated role changed drastically in September, when sophomore point guard Alexis Morris was dismissed from the team for violating team rules.\r\n",
      "Jackson is averaging 10.9 points, 6.8 assists and 3.6 rebounds a game. The Lady Bears were tied for the national lead with their 1.81 assist-to-turnover ratio, and Jackson was 15th nationally at 2.78 she has more than four times as many assists as turnovers (37 to 9) in the past four games.\r\n",
      "\"The biggest adjustment was just being more vocal, having to be that quarterback on the floor ... just having to learning all the plays,\" Jackson said. \"In that month span, going from trying to learn from (Morris), to having to be the one to learn it and teach it.\"\r\n",
      "All while playing for Mulkey, who long before winning two national championships as Baylor's coach played point guard for two national titles at Louisiana Tech and is demanding of her players at that spot.\r\n",
      "Mulkey described Jackson as \"smart, doesn't try to be something she's not.\"\r\n",
      "In a win over Iowa State last week, Jackson had her first double-double at Baylor with 11 points and 11 assists.\r\n",
      "\"Everything Chloe does with the ball in her hands impresses me, because that's like taking a wide receiver and making them a quarterback their fifth year in college,\" Mulkey said. \"An athlete might run the ball a lot, but you've got to have patterns, you've got to throw the ball on a dime when they make their cuts, you've got to have a presence in the pocket, and she's having to do all of that stuff.\"\r\n",
      "Jackson played for an elite girls basketball program at Riverdale Baptist High in Maryland, though before her sophomore year in the summer of 2011 she had moved to a different school with a standout soccer team to play both sports there.\r\n",
      "\"That was a crazy summer,\" Jackson said. \"I spent the whole summer working out, playing soccer and doing all of that, but when school started, I went to school for literally one day and then that night an earthquake occurred. ... Everything happens for a reason. In high school, that happened for a reason. This situation that I'm in right now, it all happened for a reason.\"\r\n",

      "Content:  414 PALU, Indonesia Six months after Palu was ripped apart by an earthquake, tsunami and liquefying soil that sucked neighborhoods into the earth and killed thousands, a second crisis is looming as recovery efforts stumble and a city that feels ignored begs for humanitarian assistance.\r\n",
      "Thousands of people in this city on Indonesias Sulawesi island are still living in sweltering tent cities, while construction of new permanent homes has yet to start and almost a third of temporary housing is unoccupied after aid groups and authorities failed to connect the units to essential utilities.\r\n",
      "President Joko Widodo, who is seeking a second term in elections this week, and his deputy promised that financial assistance to those whose homes were destroyed or whose loved ones were killed would be rapidly distributed. But not a cent has been paid out.\r\n",
      "Its like were forgotten, said Ade Zahra, a mother of eight living in a tent city who says its a miracle her family survived when the quake turned their village to mud and engulfed their home.\r\n",
      "Weve received no more assistance in the past two months, not only the government, but also humanitarian groups and volunteers who used to provide a lot, she said.\r\n",
      "The citys struggle to recover highlights a broader problem of neglect often suffered by remote regions in Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago home to hundreds of ethnic groups. Far from the center of economic, political and cultural power in populous Java, the region around Palu has a history of sectarian conflict and perceived indifference to its plight could embolden hard-liners.\r\n",
      "City officials, meanwhile, are worried frustration among the displaced has reached a breaking point.\r\n",
      "As anger among the refugees simmers, Widodo is focused on securing his reelection. Sulawesi mostly voted for Widodo in 2014, but he risks losing ground there this time. That could be crucial if the race is tighter than polls, which are predicting a strong Widodo victory.\r\n",
      "The Sept. 28 earthquake spawned a large localized tsunami that wiped out coastal areas, while liquefaction caused by the shaking turned entire neighborhoods into rivers of sludge. The disaster killed more than 4,400 people, making it the worlds deadliest seismic event in 2018.\r\n",
      "The central government, at the time still grappling with the aftermath of deadly earthquakes on Lombok Island, appealed for international aid but didnt declare a national disaster, which wouldve opened the door wider to foreign assistance. It prohibited international aid organizations from operating on the ground.\r\n",
      "Though the tragedy is fading from the national consciousness, large parts of Palu look like they were struck only yesterday, a daily reminder to residents of the horrors they lived through.\r\n",
      "About 90% of roads have been repaired, according to Palus mayor, but the shoreline is littered in debris and hollowed out buildings that lean precariously.\r\n",
      "Waves wash inside Apung Palu Mosque, which once sat majestically on pillars in Palu Bay. People looking for valuables pick through a vast jumble of personal belongings and house debris, all thats left of once thriving communities.\r\n",
      "In Sigi district bordering Palu, several dozen white tents emblazoned with the U.N. refugee agencys logo are home to hundreds of evacuees, who look with envy and anger at temporary housing across the road some of it occupied, some empty and some still unfinished.\r\n",
      "During the day, the tents are blazing hot and at night refugees, who include a man incapacitated by a stroke and a boy with cerebral palsy, shiver.\r\n",
      "Frustrated residents recall that not long after the disaster Vice President Jusuf Kalla visited and promised theyd soon get money to help rebuild their lives. Instead things seem to be getting worse.\r\n",
      "They have clean drinking water, but a mobile kitchen provided by an aid group closed due to lack of donations. Members of some families have jobs, but others have almost nothing, their former livelihoods gone. Some beg for money.\r\n",
      "Zahra, the mother of eight, said she hopes the government finally fulfills its promise.\r\n",
      "Have mercy on us, she said.\r\n",
      "Officially, about 173,000 people were displaced by the disaster and about 20,000 are still living in tents that Palus mayor says were designed to last three months. The actual number without stable housing is much higher.\r\n",
      "At a block of eight buildings built by a charitable foundation run by Kallas business empire, a banner announced they were handed over to the city on Feb. 14. All sit empty and unconnected to utilities, the only sign of life a few cows grazing between them.\r\n",
      "Temporary housing built nearby by another organization is occupied, some by residents of a neighborhood wiped out by liquefaction.\r\n",
      "Umira, who uses a single name, wept as she recalled the ordeal her family has endured since the night they fled a sea of moving trees and houses. Eight of her relatives were killed, including her grandson.\r\n",
      "Theyve gone from sheltering in a sports stadium to fashioning their own makeshift lodging in the ruins of a house to finally being assigned to a room in a temporary housing unit.\r\n",
      "We all cried with happiness, she said of the moment two months ago when they learned they would have housing. Even my husband cried and hugged the wall of our new home.\r\n",
      "The family still gets aid, Umira said, such as staple foods and cooking oil, though its distributed without any predictable schedule.\r\n",
      "When the aid runs out they rely on income from running an on-call motorcycle taxi service.\r\n",
      "If there is a call, we can eat, she said. If not, we will only eat rice with salt.\r\n",
      "Presley Tampubolon, the head of Palus disaster agency who oversees temporary housing, said the need for accommodation has been greater than anticipated.\r\n",
      "For every house destroyed or damaged, there would often be several generations of a family living in it. He said it would be inhuman to expect such families to fit into the 3-meter-by-4-meter (10-foot-by-13-foot) rooms that have been built.\r\n",
      "He said the government and aid groups have built temporary buildings with 5,300 total rooms that can accommodate nearly 41,000 people. But about 1,600 of those rooms are empty because they werent connected to water, electricity or sanitation, he said.\r\n",
      "Hidayat, the mayor of Palu who uses a single name, said the central government has stopped building temporary homes despite the need and construction of permanent dwellings hasnt started.\r\n",
      "Compounding the problem is that the central governments social affairs and public works ministries havent released mourning allowances and funds for people to build new homes.\r\n",
      "He said hes worried anger will soon boil over.\r\n",
      "The social affairs ministrys director of social protection and disaster victims, Margo Wiyono, said the ministry has verified 1,906 of the 4,400 names of heirs who would be entitled to mourning allowances and has proposed the finance ministry pay them.\r\n",
      "He said they were still investigating the rest.\r\n",
      "We dont want the allowances worth 15 million rupiah ($1,050) per heir to fall into the hands of irresponsible people, he said.\r\n",
      "The budget director-general at the finance ministry, Askolani, said its in the process of approving money to pay the allowances. He said releasing funds for new housing is contingent on several factors, including reviewing local government data and identifying areas for new settlements that are safe from liquefaction.\r\n",
      "Hidayat isnt waiting. He said the Tzu Chi Buddhist Foundation has agreed to build 3,000 new homes in the Palu area, but he is urging organizations and local governments from around the country to build more.\r\n",
      "Our regional capabilities are very limited, he said. As the mayor, Im begging for help to many humanitarian groups and institutions.\r\n",

      "Content:  416 PALU, Indonesia (AP) Six months after Palu was ripped apart by an earthquake, tsunami and liquefying soil that sucked neighborhoods into the earth and killed thousands, a second crisis is looming as recovery efforts stumble and a city that feels ignored begs for humanitarian assistance.\r\n",
      "Thousands of people in this city on Indonesias Sulawesi island are still living in sweltering tent cities, while construction of new permanent homes has yet to start and almost a third of temporary housing is unoccupied after aid groups and authorities failed to connect the units to essential utilities.\r\n",
      "President Joko Widodo, who is seeking a second term in elections this week, and his deputy promised that financial assistance to those whose homes were destroyed or whose loved ones were killed would be rapidly distributed. But not a cent has been paid out.\r\n",
      "Its like were forgotten, said Ade Zahra, a mother of eight living in a tent city who says its a miracle her family survived when the quake turned their village to mud and engulfed their home.\r\n",
      "Weve received no more assistance in the past two months, not only the government, but also humanitarian groups and volunteers who used to provide a lot, she said.\r\n",
      "The citys struggle to recover highlights a broader problem of neglect often suffered by remote regions in Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago home to hundreds of ethnic groups. Far from the center of economic, political and cultural power in populous Java, the region around Palu has a history of sectarian conflict and perceived indifference to its plight could embolden hard-liners.\r\n",
      "City officials, meanwhile, are worried frustration among the displaced has reached a breaking point.\r\n",
      "As anger among the refugees simmers, Widodo is focused on securing his reelection. Sulawesi mostly voted for Widodo in 2014, but he risks losing ground there this time. That could be crucial if the race is tighter than polls, which are predicting a strong Widodo victory.\r\n",
      "The Sept. 28 earthquake spawned a large localized tsunami that wiped out coastal areas, while liquefaction caused by the shaking turned entire neighborhoods into rivers of sludge. The disaster killed more than 4,400 people, making it the worlds deadliest seismic event in 2018.\r\n",
      "The central government, at the time still grappling with the aftermath of deadly earthquakes on Lombok Island, appealed for international aid but didnt declare a national disaster, which wouldve opened the door wider to foreign assistance. It prohibited international aid organizations from operating on the ground.\r\n",
      "Though the tragedy is fading from the national consciousness, large parts of Palu look like they were struck only yesterday, a daily reminder to residents of the horrors they lived through.\r\n",
      "About 90% of roads have been repaired, according to Palus mayor, but the shoreline is littered in debris and hollowed out buildings that lean precariously.\r\n",
      "Waves wash inside Apung Palu Mosque, which once sat majestically on pillars in Palu Bay. People looking for valuables pick through a vast jumble of personal belongings and house debris, all thats left of once thriving communities.\r\n",
      "In Sigi district bordering Palu, several dozen white tents emblazoned with the U.N. refugee agencys logo are home to hundreds of evacuees, who look with envy and anger at temporary housing across the road some of it occupied, some empty and some still unfinished.\r\n",
      "During the day, the tents are blazing hot and at night refugees, who include a man incapacitated by a stroke and a boy with cerebral palsy, shiver.\r\n",
      "Frustrated residents recall that not long after the disaster Vice President Jusuf Kalla visited and promised theyd soon get money to help rebuild their lives. Instead things seem to be getting worse.\r\n",
      "They have clean drinking water, but a mobile kitchen provided by an aid group closed due to lack of donations. Members of some families have jobs, but others have almost nothing, their former livelihoods gone. Some beg for money.\r\n",
      "Zahra, the mother of eight, said she hopes the government finally fulfills its promise.\r\n",
      "Have mercy on us, she said.\r\n",
      "Officially, about 173,000 people were displaced by the disaster and about 20,000 are still living in tents that Palus mayor says were designed to last three months. The actual number without stable housing is much higher.\r\n",
      "At a block of eight buildings built by a charitable foundation run by Kallas business empire, a banner announced they were handed over to the city on Feb. 14. All sit empty and unconnected to utilities, the only sign of life a few cows grazing between them.\r\n",
      "Temporary housing built nearby by another organization is occupied, some by residents of a neighborhood wiped out by liquefaction.\r\n",
      "Umira, who uses a single name, wept as she recalled the ordeal her family has endured since the night they fled a sea of moving trees and houses. Eight of her relatives were killed, including her grandson.\r\n",
      "Theyve gone from sheltering in a sports stadium to fashioning their own makeshift lodging in the ruins of a house to finally being assigned to a room in a temporary housing unit.\r\n",
      "We all cried with happiness, she said of the moment two months ago when they learned they would have housing. Even my husband cried and hugged the wall of our new home.\r\n",
      "The family still gets aid, Umira said, such as staple foods and cooking oil, though its distributed without any predictable schedule.\r\n",
      "When the aid runs out they rely on income from running an on-call motorcycle taxi service.\r\n",
      "If there is a call, we can eat, she said. If not, we will only eat rice with salt.\r\n",
      "Presley Tampubolon, the head of Palus disaster agency who oversees temporary housing, said the need for accommodation has been greater than anticipated.\r\n",
      "For every house destroyed or damaged, there would often be several generations of a family living in it. He said it would be inhuman to expect such families to fit into the 3-meter-by-4-meter (10-foot-by-13-foot) rooms that have been built.\r\n",
      "He said the government and aid groups have built temporary buildings with 5,300 total rooms that can accommodate nearly 41,000 people. But about 1,600 of those rooms are empty because they werent connected to water, electricity or sanitation, he said.\r\n",
      "Hidayat, the mayor of Palu who uses a single name, said the central government has stopped building temporary homes despite the need and construction of permanent dwellings hasnt started.\r\n",
      "Compounding the problem is that the central governments social affairs and public works ministries havent released mourning allowances and funds for people to build new homes.\r\n",
      "He said hes worried anger will soon boil over.\r\n",
      "The social affairs ministrys director of social protection and disaster victims, Margo Wiyono, said the ministry has verified 1,906 of the 4,400 names of heirs who would be entitled to mourning allowances and has proposed the finance ministry pay them.\r\n",
      "He said they were still investigating the rest.\r\n",
      "We dont want the allowances worth 15 million rupiah ($1,050) per heir to fall into the hands of irresponsible people, he said.\r\n",
      "The budget director-general at the finance ministry, Askolani, said its in the process of approving money to pay the allowances. He said releasing funds for new housing is contingent on several factors, including reviewing local government data and identifying areas for new settlements that are safe from liquefaction.\r\n",
      "Hidayat isnt waiting. He said the Tzu Chi Buddhist Foundation has agreed to build 3,000 new homes in the Palu area, but he is urging organizations and local governments from around the country to build more.\r\n",

      "Content:  417 RICHMOND, Va. (AP) The House of Delegates on Tuesday is expected to pass the first five bills in a package of legislation to improve school safety proposals drafted by a special committee after the mass shooting last year at a high school in Parkland, Florida.\r\n",
      "House Speaker Kirk Cox, a high school teacher for 30 years, and other Republican delegates held a news conference Monday to urge support for the bills, which would help schools improve security, require them to have emergency response plans and ensure that counselors spend most of their time with students.\r\n",
      "\"I know firsthand how much students and teachers deal with on a daily basis, and the last thing they need to do while learning is to be worried about their safety,\" said Cox, who chaired the Select Committee on School Safety.\r\n",
      "The select committee was formed shortly after 17 students and staff members were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland last February.\r\n",
      "Cox described the committee as a bipartisan effort it included 12 Republicans and 10 Democrats but only Republican members were present at the press conference.\r\n",
      "According to GOP officials, the panel issued 24 priority recommendations in December, resulting in 10 pieces of legislation. Five of those bills have cleared House committees and are up for final consideration Tuesday in the House.\r\n",
      "\"These proposals on the House floor this week will span topics that range from school counseling, mental health, to building codes and security enhancements,\" said Del. Daniel Marshall III, R-Danville. \"Taken together, we have laid out a multiyear blueprint for improving school safety that we can draw from as we move into the legislative process.\"\r\n",
      "The bills, which delegates tentatively approved Monday, are:\r\n",
      "- HB 1725, which would require local officials to have a plan that all security enhancements in school buildings comply with building and fire codes.\r\n",
      "- HB 1729, requiring school counselors to spend at least 80 percent of their staff time \"in direct counseling,\" rather than in administrative tasks.\r\n",
      "- HB 1732, to require elementary and secondary schools to host at least one general emergency drill a year along with standard fire, tornado and earthquake drills.\r\n",
      "- HB 1733, which would ensure that school resource officers understand their roles on school grounds as defined by the local law enforcement agency.\r\n",
      "- HB 1738, which says that an architect trained in crime prevention must approve any school building or renovation plans, focusing on \"corridors, open spaces and floor plans through the lens of school safety.\"\r\n",
      "After approval by the House, the bills then would go to the Senate for consideration.\r\n",
      "House Democrats have criticized the select committee for declining to consider policies concerning firearms. So they created a study group called the Safe Virginia Initiative.\r\n",
      "\"Unfortunately, despite requests from House Democrats, the decision was made that the Select Committee would specifically exclude any exploration of gun safety proposals as well as the role that access to guns contributes to the multiple incidents of carnage,\" the initiative's report states.\r\n",
      "Headed by two Fairfax Democrats House Democratic Leader Eileen Filler-Corn and Del. Kathleen Murphy the initiative recommended that the state require background checks on all gun buyers, the reporting of lost or stolen firearms, and in-person training for concealed handgun permits, rather than video training. The Safe Virginia Initiative also called for reinstating the state's limit of one handgun purchase per month.\r\n",

      "Content:  418 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) A gas explosion in San Francisco shot a tower of flames into the sky and burned five buildings including one of the city's popular restaurants before firefighters brought the blaze under control. There were no injuries.\r\n",
      "Wednesday's explosion and fire sent panicked residents and workers in the city's Inner Richmond neighborhood fleeing into the streets as flames shot above the rooftops of nearby three-story buildings.\r\n",
      "\"We just felt the shaking, and the next thing we knew, people were banging on the door to tell people it's time to start evacuating,\" said resident Nick Jalali, 28, who was cooking at home when the electricity cut out.\r\n",
      "Utility crews put out the fire about three hours after private construction workers cut a natural gas line, which ignited the fire, San Francisco Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White said. Authorities initially said five workers were missing, but the entire construction crew was found safe, and no other injuries were reported.\r\n",
      "Hayes-White said the construction crew was apparently working on fiber-optic wires.\r\n",
      "Five buildings were damaged, including a building housing Hong Kong Lounge II, a reservations-required dim sum restaurant that is a fixture on the city's \"best of\" lists. The fire began on the street in front of the restaurant.\r\n",
      "Officials evacuated several nearby buildings, including a medical clinic and apartments, Hayes-White said. Vehicles on a busy street were rerouted as authorities cordoned off the bustling neighborhood.\r\n",
      "Caroline Gasparini, 24, who lives kitty-corner from where the fire was, said she and her housemate were in their living room when the windows started rattling. She looked up to see flames reflected in the glass.\r\n",
      "\"We went into crisis mode,\" Gasparini said. \"We grabbed our shoes, grabbed our laptops and grabbed our passports and just left.\"\r\n",
      "Gasparini said they saw employees of the burning restaurant run out the back door and people fleeing down the block.\r\n",
      "Firefighters worked to keep the fire from spreading while Pacific Gas &amp; Electric crews tried to shut off the natural gas line.\r\n",
      "\"It's complicated,\" Hayes-White said of stopping the flow of gas through the damaged pipe. Though she later acknowledged that \"as a fire chief and a resident, yes, I would have liked to see it mitigated.\"\r\n",
      "PG&amp;E spokeswoman Melissa Subbotin said state excavation rules required crews to hand dig around multiple subsurface pipelines of various sizes before they were eventually able to \"squeeze\" a four-inch plastic line.\r\n",
      "She said since the fire was contained to a limited area, the utility had to weigh the threat from the fire with the risk that would come from more drastic action.\r\n",
      "\"Had we turned the gas off to a transmission system, we would have shut off gas to nearly the entire city of San Francisco,\" she said. \"The objective of this was to turn the gas off safely and as quickly as possible.\"\r\n",
      "Subbotin said PG&amp;E would shut off a transmission line in an earthquake.\r\n",
      "PG&amp;E spokesman Paul Doherty stressed that the workers who cut the gas line are not affiliated with the utility, which is under heightened scrutiny over its natural gas pipelines. A PG&amp;E pipeline exploded under a neighborhood south of San Francisco in 2010, killing eight people and wiping out a neighborhood in suburban San Bruno.\r\n",
      "A U.S. judge PG&amp;E $3 million for a conviction on six felony charges of failing to properly maintain the pipeline and the utility remains under a federal judge's watch in that case.\r\n",

      "Content:  419 Immigrants from Honduras and Nepal have filed a lawsuit alleging the Trump administration unfairly ended a program that lets them live and work in the United States.\r\n",
      "The lawsuit filed late Sunday in federal court in San Francisco alleges that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's decision to end so-called temporary protected status for the countries was motivated by racism.\r\n",
      "The suit which was filed on behalf of six immigrants and two of their American-born children also alleges that the department changed how it evaluated conditions in these countries when determining whether immigrants could return there.\r\n",
      "\"We bring evidence the Trump administration has repeatedly denigrated non-white non-European immigrants and reviewed TPS designations with a goal of removing such non-white non-European immigrants from the United States,\" said Minju Cho, a staff attorney at Asian Americans Advancing Justice in Los Angeles.\r\n",
      "The group is one of several representing the immigrant plaintiffs, who live California, Minnesota, Maryland, Virginia and Connecticut.\r\n",
      "A message seeking comment was left for the Department of Homeland Security.\r\n",
      "The lawsuit is the latest in a series of court filings challenging the Trump administration's decision to end the program for a cluster of countries whose citizens have lived and worked legally in the United States for years.\r\n",
      "Last year, a federal judge in San Francisco temporarily blocked the U.S. government from halting the program for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan. The suit filed on behalf of citizens of those countries, in addition to this one, cited Trump's vulgar language during a meeting last year to describe African countries.\r\n",
      "The U.S. government grants temporary protected status, also known as TPS, to citizens of countries ravaged by natural disasters or war so they can stay and work legally in the United States until the situation improves back home.\r\n",
      "The status is short-term but renewable and some immigrants have lived in the country for decades, raising American-born children, buying homes and building careers.\r\n",
      "Critics have said the program was meant to be temporary and shouldn't be extended for so long.\r\n",
      "The Trump administration announced last year that the program would be ending for Honduras and Nepal. Honduras was designated for the program after a devastating 1998 hurricane and about 86,000 immigrants from the country have the status, according to the lawsuit.\r\n",
      "About 15,000 immigrants from Nepal which was designated following an earthquake in 2015 are covered, the suit said.\r\n",
      "Together, these immigrants have more than 50,000 American-born children who would be affected by an end to the program, which lets those who are already in the United States stay in the country and obtain work permits, the suit said.\r\n",
      "One of them is the 9-year-old daughter of Honduran citizen Donaldo Posadas Caceres, who came to the United States shortly before the hurricane in 1998. After Honduras was designated for the program, he obtained the status, and now works as a bridge painter and owns his home in Baltimore, Maryland.\r\n",
      "The girl, who is in fourth grade, likes math and reading and has big plans for the future. \"She dreams of growing up to be President because she wants to help people who come here from other countries,\" the suit said.\r\n",

But the term now has new meaning: Real estate property could actually be underwater because of future climate change.\r\n",
      "Hardly a day goes by without yet another report, editorial commentary or prediction about climate change and its risks, evidenced convincingly by countless scientific studies. Observable, measurable evidence includes increasing ocean and land temperatures; weather patterns and weather-related events of abnormal frequency and intensity such as hurricanes, flooding and wildfires; changing biosphere patterns; accelerating glacial melting at the poles and extreme northern and southern latitudes; and rising sea level.\r\n",
      "But you dont need to be a scientist to understand that economic and physical climate change effects could adversely affect real estate. Risks exist at all geographic scales and places: along seacoasts; within watersheds; on hillsides; and in vulnerable urban, suburban and exurban areas. Individual buildings likewise are at risk, depending on their location and construction.\r\n",
      "Among recent reports worth reading is Climate Risk and Real Estate Investment Decision-Making, published by the Urban Land Institute (ULI) and Heitman, a real estate investment management firm. This is truly one report that President Trump real estate developer, investor and owner might actually want to read. Fundamentally about money, it identifies sources and impacts of physical risks and of transition risks associated with climate change.\r\n",
      "Physical risks are those caused directly by specific catastrophic events hurricanes, sea level rise, drought, wildfires that are ultimately attributable to climate change and shifting weather patterns. Among the many negative impacts of such events are greatly increased cost of maintaining, repairing and reconstructing seriously damaged or destroyed structures; soaring costs of property insurance; and post-event business and economic productivity losses.\r\n",
      "[Frustrated by the high cost of real estate? Government regulation is partly to blame.]\r\n",
      "Less obvious are transition risks over time not attributable to single catastrophic events. Progressive climate change could depress real estate market growth and viability, as well as property values. Public policies and regulations aimed at mitigating climate change effects could increase investment and ownership expenses, including taxes, insurance, code compliance, infrastructure and financing. Essential resources, such as energy and water, could become increasingly scarce and ever more costly.\r\n",
      "The ULI-Heitman report pointedly cites insurance industry volatility stemming from uncertainty about an unknowable future and potentially skyrocketing premiums necessary to cover ever larger losses and claims. Viable and affordable insurance, a key to risk management, depends on being able to recognize and reasonably evaluate future risks.\r\n",
      "As the report explains, the challenge is figuring out how to measure and mitigate future climate change risks affecting the sustainability and physical resilience of property, as well as property value, capital appreciation, revenue and liquidity. Real estate industry professionals are beginning to address this by analytically mapping specific physical risks associated with properties they own. Mapping incorporates historical and current, site-specific data with predictive geophysical, meteorological and economic modeling. Even earthquake risk may enter into calculations.\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, LEED certified architects, engineers, real estate developers and government agencies have already taken steps to address and mitigate climate change impacts. They are using more environmentally sustainable materials, more renewable energy sources and less fossil fuels, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change. Both the federal government and the District have adopted sustainability building codes and guidelines for site development and construction to create projects with zero carbon footprints and minimal adverse environmental impact.\r\n",
      "[Creating an accessory dwelling unit is no easy process]\r\n",
      "Additionally, in many American jurisdictions, including the Washington region, building within designated flood plains or wetlands is not permitted. This prudent policy protects those portions of the natural landscape that not only are subject to flooding, but also retain surface and subsurface water while helping to control flooding.\r\n",
      "The ULI-Heitman report cites Floridas Miami-Dade County to illustrate how a highly vulnerable region is attempting to mitigate multiple climate change risks and augment regional sustainability and resilience. The county is a partner in the Southeast Florida Climate Change Compact which has completed plans and committed funds to address greenhouse gas emissions, sea-level rise, storm-water management and flood control.\r\n",
      "Remarkably, regional residents have proved willing to pay higher taxes. Miamis proactive and strategic investment helps mitigate the inherent physical risks it faces and makes a case for not red-lining regions at risk from climate change, said Jim Murley, Miami-Dade Countys chief resilience officer. Savvy investors, Murley added, will look at both the physical risks and what cities are doing to mitigate risk for all of their real estate.\r\n",
      "A regional compact like the one in Florida would make sense for the Chesapeake Bay region encompassing low-lying, at-risk areas of Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware.\r\n",
      "In other words, you might want to hang on to your property in south Florida or the Eastern Shore.\r\n",
      "The real estate decision-making bottom-line is clear. To stay afloat, we must act together and make public-private commitments, regionally and unselfishly, to implement and pay for climate change risk mitigation. Otherwise all of us will end up underwater physically and financially.\r\n",

      "Content:  423 NEW DELHI (AP) New Delhi shop owner Ram Shankar Rai spends at least two hours a day going through political news and videos shared with him on social media.\r\n",
      "Rai looked intently at a flurry of videos and photos on WhatsApp about an Indian airstrike in Pakistan, including pictures labeled as militants' corpses.\r\n",
      "There was just one problem: The photos were not of militants but of casualties of a 2005 earthquake that killed thousands of people in Pakistan.\r\n",
      "But the 50-year-old didn't see anything amiss. \"It's news,\" he said. \"How can it be fake?\"\r\n",
      "As the world's largest democracy starts voting this week in a phased general election carried out over six weeks, this attitude is posing a problem for election officials seeking to combat the spread of fake news among a population that experts say has proven highly susceptible to believing it.\r\n",
      "Despite efforts by India's Election Commission to work with social media giants, urging them to tackle the spread of misinformation, at least one former top election official is warning that fake news could end up being the deciding factor in some constituencies with extremely tight races.\r\n",
      "The election is already taking place in a charged atmosphere as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party seeks a second term by pushing policies that some say have increased religious tensions and undermined multiculturalism.\r\n",
      "The opposition Congress party, which is also spending sizable sums of money on social media ads, is trying to revive its past glory and turn around a declining voter base.\r\n",
      "Tackling fake news is a huge challenge in India, a nation with 1.14 billion cellphone connections, the most Facebook users in the world at 300 million, and another 240 million users of the messaging service WhatsApp. In such an environment, fake news can spread faster than regulators can act.\r\n",
      "Watchdogs say in the run-up to the vote they've seen everything from manipulated pictures being picked up by mainstream news media, to misrepresented quotes sparking communal division, false news and hateful propaganda. And it looks like people are buying it.\r\n",
      "Indian internet users, many of whom are relatively new to the web, may lack the awareness of knowing that \"just because it's on a screen does not mean it's true,\" said Apar Gupta, who runs an advocacy group called the Internet Freedom Foundation.\r\n",
      "India's problem with fake news isn't new, though, and it has already proven to have deadly consequences. In late 2018, at least 20 people were killed in mob attacks that were triggered by rumors on social media of strangers abducting children from villages.\r\n",
      "Efforts by social media giants to combat fake news in the country were intensified after executives were called in by the Election Commission earlier this year and told to curb the spread of manipulative political information and adhere to the country's laws on election campaigning.\r\n",
      "Social media companies followed that with a \"Voluntary Code of Ethics\" for the elections that they submitted to the government. It's essentially a best practices agreement that they will try to abide by the Election Commission's suggestions and rules, including prohibiting campaign advertisements for at least 48 hours before polling begins.\r\n",
      "But at least two former Election Commission bosses said they don't believe enough is being done.\r\n",
      "\"The potential of mischief for subversion of the process of elections represented by social media is immense,\" said N. Gopalaswami, who was India's chief election commissioner from 2006 to 2009.\r\n",
      "He said he was concerned fake news could play a huge role in very tight races.\r\n",
      "Gupta said the Election Commission should have enforced accountability for political parties and social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp, with penalties for violations.\r\n",
      "\"India has clearly not done enough,\" he said, adding that some of the responsibility lies with the social media platforms.\r\n",
      "\"The internet has grown up and is having to leave its parents' home and find a job,\" he said, suggesting that platforms should tune their search engine algorithms to weigh the credibility of sources more heavily than ads and viral content.\r\n",
      "Digital platforms have been scrambling to devise strategies to tackle the spread of false information ahead of the election.\r\n",
      "Facebook announced a variety of measures last month, from blocking fake accounts to employing third-party fact-checking organizations for the elections.\r\n",
      "WhatsApp has introduced a fact-checking helpline, encouraging users to flag messages for verification. It also started re-circulating an old advertising video urging people to \"share joy, not rumors.\" The video was first launched after the 2018 mob attacks.\r\n",
      "But with new pages and accounts being created daily to push political content, it's a hefty task.\r\n",
      "\"It is an adversarial space,\" said Kaushik Iyer, a Facebook engineering manager who works on election integrity and safety.\r\n",
      "\"What that means is that we will always see adaptation. We will always see new threats emerge,\" he told The Associated Press in an interview at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California.\r\n",
      "He said Facebook was getting better at tracking down the misrepresented and manipulated videos and audio that form a big chunk of fake content on their platform in India.\r\n",
      "And for all its negatives, social media can also play a positive role in an election, especially for young voters who say it has enabled them to better understand candidates and engage with them.\r\n",
      "\"Rather than campaign rallies where we are just passive observers, social media is a better representation of our opinions,\" said Sarthak Singh Dalal, a history student at Delhi University.\r\n",
      "Rai, the shop owner, said he has started to take a closer look at the social media content forwarded to him, trying to identify biases hidden in what he had just considered news.\r\n",

      "Content:  424 PARKLAND, Fla. (AP) The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre a year ago renewed the national debate on guns and school safety, turned some victims' parents and surviving students into political activists and at least temporarily ended the local sheriff's career.\r\n",
      "But Thursday's anniversary will primarily be about remembering the 14 students and three staff members who died in the third high-profile mass shooting in Florida since 2016. An interfaith service will be held at a Parkland park, near the school, to remember the victims. Students also will perform service projects and observe a moment of silence and a non-denominational, temporary temple will open in neighboring Coral Springs for people to pay their respects. The structure will eventually be burned in a purification ceremony. Security throughout the community and at schools will be high.\r\n",
      "\"We don't need (the anniversary) to remind us what happened. We live with it every day,\" said businessman Andrew Pollack, whose 18-year-old daughter Meadow died in the attack. He met with President Donald Trump at the White House after the shooting and became an adviser to Gov. Ron DeSantis and his predecessor, Rick Scott. Other fathers like Fred Guttenberg and Manuel Oliver have become active in Democratic politics.\r\n",
      "And victims' relatives from both sides helped lead the successful push to remove Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel. DeSantis suspended the Democratic sheriff last month, citing incompetence in his handling of the shooting. Israel is fighting the suspension in the state Senate and says he will try to win back the office in next year's election.\r\n",
      "The massacre also led some Stoneman Douglas students to form the group \"March for Our Lives,\" which holds rallies nationwide calling for tougher gun regulations and toured the country registering young adults to vote.\r\n",
      "\"It was the kids themselves that made Parkland an unusual shooting,\" said Adam Winkler, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law and gun rights expert. Just in Florida, 49 people died in the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando and five died at Fort Lauderdale's airport in 2017. There have been other notable mass shootings across the country during that period at a Las Vegas concert, a Pittsburgh synagogue and a Texas high school. But none resonated politically like Stoneman Douglas.\r\n",
      "\"What we haven't seen is a mobilization of the students in quite the same way,\" Winkler said.\r\n",
      "But Thursday will be mostly a day to push aside politics. Victims' families who have spoken publicly say they will spend the day quietly, visiting their loved one's grave or participating in low-key events like a community walk.\r\n",
      "\"We are going to simply reflect and remember,\" said Tony Montalto, president of the victims' families' organization, Stand With Parkland. \"That is the best thing.\" Montalto's 14-year-old daughter Gina died in the shooting.\r\n",
      "At Stoneman Douglas, students will mark the tragedy by working on service projects. They also can receive mental health counseling and visit therapy dogs. Volunteers will provide massages and manicures.\r\n",
      "Mickey Pope, the district's chief of student-support services, said the staff worked with mental health counselors, community groups, the victims' families and others for four months to devise a plan they believe will honor those killed and allow students and staff to mourn.\r\n",
      "Still, many Stoneman Douglas students are skipping school. For some it's too emotional; others don't want to be in the spotlight.\r\n",
      "Alexis Grogan, a junior, said she'll spend the day picking up beach trash, dedicating her work to those who died.\r\n",
      "\"I survived something and I don't want to waste what I call a second chance at life because those who have passed don't get that,\" she said. \"We have to make a difference for them.\"\r\n",
      "In Coral Springs, San Francisco-area artist David Best will open \"The Temple of Time,\" which at 1,600 square feet (150 square meters) represents the indefinite period it will take for the community to come to grips with the slayings. It's an Asian design with a spire roof that has intricate designs cut into it.\r\n",
      "Best rejected naming it \"The Temple of Healing\" because he said that is impossible for the victims and their families. Since 2000, he has built such temples worldwide, including in Northern Ireland for those killed in political strife and in Nepal for the 2015 earthquake victims. Like those structures, the Stoneman Douglas temple will be burned along with whatever mementos, writings and art that mourners leave behind. That ceremony will happen in May.\r\n",
      "Most construction materials and other expenses are being paid by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's public arts foundation, but neither Best nor his workers are paid.\r\n",
      "\"When the smoke goes up and the flames go up, it will have a great meaning,\" said volunteer Tony Bianco, an Army veteran and artist from Coral Gables,\r\n",

I said [there was no collusion with the] president of the United States, Giuliani added. There is not a single bit of evidence the president of the United States committed the only crime you can commit here, conspired with the Russians to hack the DNC. Watch the remarkable exchange here. \r\n",
      "President Trump stops to talk to reporters on Monday at the White House (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\r\n",
      "At the White House\r\n",
      "\"HE BELIEVES WHAT HE BELIEVES:  That's what Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-Tex.), who met with President Trump at the White House on Wednesday along with a handful of his colleagues from the Problem Solvers Caucus, told Power Up about the president's very serious misconceptions of the border. \r\n",
      "He mentioned, 'I dont even know why we have ports of entry. You can just drive down the border and turn left into the U.S.' ... I think hes convinced himself that thats what the border is, Gonzalez told us. I was listening to him today. He makes a lot of comments that are so untrue. But I believe that he actually believes them. \r\n",
      "Trump's convictions about the southern border aren't just something he talks about privately, but repeatedly touts publicly. See journalist Daniel Dale's 52-item false claim list on immigration made by Trump in just the last week. \r\n",
      "Entrenched: Unlike his colleagues who turned down the president's invitation to meet earlier in the week, Gonzalez showed up  in good faith along with Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.), Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), Max Rose (D-N.Y.) and Abigail Spanberger (D-Va). The Democrats proposed opening the government for 30 days to try to negotiate a solution to Trump's demands for $5.7 billion for a border wall while furloughed employees get back to work. (The proposal is similar to one by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Trump promptly rejected the idea). \r\n",
      "But Trump responded that he is opposed to reopening the government without a guarantee that negotiations would result with a physical barrier. Gonzalez added that Trump believes he's winning the shutdown standoff.\r\n",
      "Not so much: A new poll out this morning from NPR/NBC News/Marist found that Trump's approval rating is down by a net of 7 points since December, when the shutdown began. Currently, 39 percent of respondents approve of Trump (down from 42 percent last month) and 53 percent disapprove (down from 49 percent in December).\r\n",
      "The poll showed him dropping significantly with his base: Among suburban men, Trump dropped a net of 18 points to a disapproval rating of 48 percent from 39 percent; down a net of 14 points with white evangelicals; and down 10 points with Republicans, from an approval rating last month of 90 to 83 percent.\r\n",
      "More from Gonzalez: There's a lot of pressure in people's districts of folks not working and folks not getting paid so at a minimum, we had the responsibility to meet with the president, see where we are and whether or we could push this negotiation. But he's clearly very entrenched on wanting a border barrier, which is very tough sell for a lot of members in Congress both Democrats and Republicans. \r\n",
      "Alternative reality; Alternative facts: Gonzalez described the meeting including Vice President Pence, acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, senior adviser Jared Kushner, and press secretary Sarah Sanders as positive and constructive. But a senior GOP Hill aide told Power Up that they hadn't caught wind of any movement of a deal in over a week.\r\n",
      "Brookings Institution's William Galston told Power Up he doesn't foresee an end to the shutdown until Trump delegates negotiations to people in his White House or party who are at least prepared to negotiate on the basis of a common set of facts with the people on the other side of all of this. \r\n",
      "Trump has changed the terms of just about everything, Galston said. He brought with him into the White House a handful of conclusions and propensities that he had been developing for decades and I cant think of anything in the external world that would be likely to change his mind about any of these things. And the wall is not the only example of fixed ideas in the Oval Office serving as a buffer against a contradictory reality. \r\n",
      "Trump is operating under the self-perception that he's winning. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) thinks otherwise, feeling confident enough to raise the stakes by sending a letter urging the president to postpone the State of the Union address to Congress because of the shutdown. The Post's Paul Kane, Philip Rucker and Josh Dawsey write that Pelosi's new and more confrontational approach and self-declared mandate to provide a check on the presidents power ... is helping to keep Democrats largely united while energizing liberals who have yearned for a leader to challenge Trump directly. \r\n",
      "The key quote: She understands political leverage. She wields the knife, Josh Holmes, an adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), said. \r\n",
      "Privately, one adviser said, Trump has complained about the quotes he reads from Pelosi about him in newspapers but has said he is impressed by her political savvy, The Post reports. \r\n",
      "We are getting crushed! The NYT's Maggie Haberman and Annie Karni report Trump told Mulvaney after watching some recent coverage of the shutdown.Why cant we get a deal?\r\n",
      "Officials told The Post's Robert Costa the White House \"would much rather be fighting in a public drama with Speaker Pelosi on SOTU than in engaging with moderate gripes about the shutdown.

      "BREXIT AND US: Sure, it's happening 4,000 miles away, but in the age of globalization, the Brexit mess has major international consequences. So Power Up asked Adam Taylor, Post foreign reporter, to walk us through how Britain's withdrawal would affect the United States. Here's Adam: \r\n",
      "To an American reader, Brexit may seem like a distant  and perhaps, amusingly alien  national disaster. But Britain's tortuous path out of the European Union may well have an impact on those in the United States too. After the defeat of May's withdrawal agreement this week, the chance of a 'no deal' Brexit  where Britain leaves the E.U. without a new trade deal on March 29  is increased.\r\n",
      "If Britain can't get a deal, it will revert to World Trade Organization rules on its borders and ports of entry. This would largely affect trade, but it may also [pose] problems for travelers; there have been warnings [of] 'millions of passengers potentially grounded in airports unable to take a flight.'\"\r\n",
      "There could be bigger economic knock-on effects. The governor of the Bank of England has said that a no-deal Brexit could cause [an] economic crisis that would rival the crash of 2008. American regulators have warned that U.S. companies are already being effected by Brexit and said that investors may be undervaluing the shock that a 'no deal' Brexit would cause.\r\n",
      "Brexit has already weakened the traditional 'special relationship' between Westminster and Washington  Britain is simply too preoccupied by its European woes to serve much use backing the United States up on the world stage. And though May had hoped to tie herself to Trump 'Mr. Brexit,' in his own words  their relationship has broken down.\r\n",
      "But if May is replaced by her left-leaning rival, Jeremy Corbyn, things could go further south. The Labour Party leader has made it clear he has little time for Trump, who he has branded a 'rich, white' man with a 'fake anti-elitism.' If Corbyn can oust May, as he tried to this week, it will be he who is charged with negotiating a bilateral trade deal with Trump.\r\n",

      "Content:  426 CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (Reuters) - Husna Ahmed was 19 when she arrived in New Zealand from Bangladesh on her wedding day. Waiting to meet her was Farid, the man she would marry in a few hours, as their families had agreed. \r\n",
      "A quarter of a century later, the life they had built together was torn apart at the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch when a gunman walked into the building, firing on worshippers at Friday prayers. \r\n",
      "Husna encountered the gunman on his way out of the mosque. He shot her on the footpath. She fell and he fired two more shots, killing her instantly. \r\n",
      "Farid, who uses a wheelchair after an earlier accident, was talking to a friend and was delayed from joining worshippers at his usual spot at the front of the mosque, instead praying in a small side room. \r\n",
      "He managed to escape when he heard the shooting begin, returning when the gunman left, to find many of his friends and community members dead and comfort those who were dying. \r\n",
      "Farid found out about his wife’s death when a detective he knew called his niece as they waited outside the mosque. \r\n",
      "She passed the phone: “I don’t want you to wait the whole night, Farid. Go home, she will not come,” Farid said the detective told him. \r\n",
      "“At the moment I hear that, my response was I felt numb,” Farid told Reuters. “I had tears but I didn’t break down.” His niece crumbled. \r\n",
      "A total of 50 people were killed in the rampage, with as many wounded, as the gunman went from Al Noor to another mosque in the South Island city. \r\n",
      "Most victims were migrants or refugees from countries including Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Syria, Turkey, Somalia and Afghanistan. \r\n",
      "Husna was one of five members of a growing but tight-knit Bangladeshi community killed, according to the Bangladesh consul in New Zealand, Shafiqur Rahman Bhuiyan. Four others were wounded, one critically, he added. \r\n",
      "Members of the Bangladesh cricket team, in town for a test match against New Zealand, narrowly avoided the carnage, turning up at the Al Noor mosque soon after the attack took place. \r\n",
      "Based on what eyewitnesses told him, Farid said instead of hiding, Husna helped women and children inside the mosque and ran to the front of the building to look for him. \r\n",
      "“She’s such a person who always put other people first and she was even not afraid to give her life saving other people,” Farid said. \r\n",
      "Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist, has been charged with murder. He entered no plea and police said he is likely to face more charges. \r\n",
      "The slaughter has rocked Christchurch, and New Zealand, to its core, blanketing the city in grief and driving Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to promise swift gun law reform. \r\n",
      "Farid said he had forgiven his wife’s killer. \r\n",
      "“I want to give the message to the person who did this, or if he has any friends who also think like this: I still love you,” Farid said. “I want to hug you and I want to tell him in face that I am talking from my heart. I have no grudge against you, I never hated you, I will never hate you.” \r\n",
      "LIKE A MOTHER \r\n",
      "A few hours after the massacre as evening fell, the front room of Farid’s home in a sleepy Christchurch suburb where he runs a homeopathy business was full with survivors and friends grieving for a woman many described as like a mother to them. \r\n",
      "Husna was born on 12 October in 1974 in Sylhet, a city on the banks the Surma River, in northeastern Bangladesh. She was so fast that Shahzalal Junior High School would only let her run three races, to give her rivals a chance, Farid said. \r\n",
      "She moved to New Zealand in 1994. \r\n",
      "Thin, nervous and overwhelmed by leaving everyone she knew for a new life in an alien country, she burst into tears when her husband-to-be picked her up from Auckland airport. \r\n",
      "He comforted her on the long drive back to Nelson, where he was living, and where she quickly found her feet. \r\n",
      "With almost no other Bangladeshis in the small city, Husna made English-speaking friends and learned the language within six months. Farid said she spoke it with more of a Kiwi accent than he did. \r\n",
      "When Farid’s workmates at a meatpacking plant agreed to work half an hour longer on Fridays so he could take a break to pray, she cooked them a feast every week in thanks. \r\n",
      "And when Farid was partially paralysed after being run over by a car outside his house, after four years of marriage, she moved with him to Christchurch and became his nurse. \r\n",
      "“Our hobby was we used to talk to each other. A lot. And we never felt bored,” he said. \r\n",
      "REBUILDING CHRISTCHURCH \r\n",
      "When Christchurch was razed by a deadly earthquake in 2011, Husna helped settle an influx of Bangladeshi migrants - qualified engineers, metalworkers and builders - who came to assist the rebuilding of the shattered city. \r\n",
      "Mohammad Omar Faruk, 36, was one of the new arrivals. Faruk was working as a welder in Singapore but leapt at the opportunity to come to New Zealand where working conditions were better and permanent residency was possible. \r\n",
      "Faruk was also killed at Al Noor mosque. \r\n",
      "His employer, Rob van Peer, said he had allowed his team to leave early last Friday after they finished a job by lunchtime, meaning Faruk could attend Friday prayers. \r\n",
      "Van Peer said Faruk was loved by his colleagues for his loyal and friendly personality and fast, precise welds. \r\n",

      "Many new workers to Christchurch brought young families, or were starting them and Husna took it upon herself to care for women through their pregnancies, often waking Farid at all hours so he could drive her to the births. \r\n",
      "“We think she’s like a motherif there’s something we needed, we go to Husna,” said Mohammed Jahangir Alan, another welder. \r\n",
      "Husna guided his wife, then 19, to a midwife and a doctor and joined her in the delivery room as she gave birth to a baby girl, Alan said. \r\n",
      "A few days later Husna shaved the infant’s head, an Islamic ritual which she did for dozens of children in the community. She was so gentle the baby fell asleep while she pulled the razor over the soft skin. \r\n",
      "Husna would also lead the customary washing and prayer ritual for women who died. She was due to lead a workshop the day after her death to teach other women the process. \r\n",

      "Content:  429 PALU, Indonesia Six months after Palu was ripped apart by an earthquake, tsunami and liquefying soil that sucked neighborhoods into the earth and killed thousands, a second crisis is looming as recovery efforts stumble and a city that feels ignored begs for humanitarian assistance.\r\n",
      "Thousands of people in this city on Indonesia's Sulawesi island are still living in sweltering tent cities, while construction of new permanent homes has yet to start and almost a third of temporary housing is unoccupied after aid groups and authorities failed to connect the units to essential utilities.\r\n",
      "President Joko Widodo, who is seeking a second term in elections this week, and his deputy promised that financial assistance to those whose homes were destroyed or whose loved ones were killed would be rapidly distributed. But not a cent has been paid out.\r\n",
      "\"It's like we're forgotten,\" said Ade Zahra, a mother of eight living in a tent city who says it's a miracle her family survived when the quake turned their village to mud and engulfed their home.\r\n",
      "\"We've received no more assistance in the past two months, not only the government, but also humanitarian groups and volunteers who used to provide a lot,\" she said.\r\n",
      "The city's struggle to recover highlights a broader problem of neglect often suffered by remote regions in Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago home to hundreds of ethnic groups. Far from the center of economic, political and cultural power in populous Java, the region around Palu has a history of sectarian conflict and perceived indifference to its plight could embolden hard-liners.\r\n",
      "City officials, meanwhile, are worried frustration among the displaced has reached a breaking point.\r\n",
      "As anger among the refugees simmers, Widodo is focused on securing his reelection. Sulawesi mostly voted for Widodo in 2014, but he risks losing ground there this time. That could be crucial if the race is tighter than polls, which are predicting a strong Widodo victory.\r\n",
      "The Sept. 28 earthquake spawned a large localized tsunami that wiped out coastal areas, while liquefaction caused by the shaking turned entire neighborhoods into rivers of sludge. The disaster killed more than 4,400 people, making it the world's deadliest seismic event in 2018.\r\n",
      "The central government, at the time still grappling with the aftermath of deadly earthquakes on Lombok Island, appealed for international aid but didn't declare a national disaster, which would've opened the door wider to foreign assistance. It prohibited international aid organizations from operating on the ground.\r\n",
      "Though the tragedy is fading from the national consciousness, large parts of Palu look like they were struck only yesterday, a daily reminder to residents of the horrors they lived through.\r\n",
      "About 90% of roads have been repaired, according to Palu's mayor, but the shoreline is littered in debris and hollowed out buildings that lean precariously.\r\n",
      "Waves wash inside Apung Palu Mosque, which once sat majestically on pillars in Palu Bay. People looking for valuables pick through a vast jumble of personal belongings and house debris, all that's left of once thriving communities.\r\n",
      "In Sigi district bordering Palu, several dozen white tents emblazoned with the U.N. refugee agency's logo are home to hundreds of evacuees, who look with envy and anger at temporary housing across the road — some of it occupied, some empty and some still unfinished.\r\n",
      "During the day, the tents are blazing hot and at night refugees, who include a man incapacitated by a stroke and a boy with cerebral palsy, shiver.\r\n",
      "Frustrated residents recall that not long after the disaster Vice President Jusuf Kalla visited and promised they'd soon get money to help rebuild their lives. Instead things seem to be getting worse.\r\n",
      "They have clean drinking water, but a mobile kitchen provided by an aid group closed due to lack of donations. Members of some families have jobs, but others have almost nothing, their former livelihoods gone. Some beg for money.\r\n",
      "Zahra, the mother of eight, said she hopes the government finally fulfills its promise.\r\n",
      "\"Have mercy on us,\" she said.\r\n",
      "Officially, about 173,000 people were displaced by the disaster and about 20,000 are still living in tents that Palu's mayor says were designed to last three months. The actual number without stable housing is much higher.\r\n",
      "At a block of eight buildings built by a charitable foundation run by Kalla's business empire, a banner announced they were handed over to the city on Feb. 14. All sit empty and unconnected to utilities, the only sign of life a few cows grazing between them.\r\n",
      "Temporary housing built nearby by another organization is occupied, some by residents of a neighborhood wiped out by liquefaction.\r\n",
      "Umira, who uses a single name, wept as she recalled the ordeal her family has endured since the night they fled a sea of moving trees and houses. Eight of her relatives were killed, including her grandson.\r\n",
      "They've gone from sheltering in a sports stadium to fashioning their own makeshift lodging in the ruins of a house to finally being assigned to a room in a temporary housing unit.\r\n",
      "\"We all cried with happiness,\" she said of the moment two months ago when they learned they would have housing. \"Even my husband cried and hugged the wall of our new home.\"\r\n",
      "The family still gets aid, Umira said, such as staple foods and cooking oil, though it's distributed without any predictable schedule.\r\n",
      "When the aid runs out they rely on income from running an on-call motorcycle taxi service.\r\n",
      "\"If there is a call, we can eat,\" she said. \"If not, we will only eat rice with salt.\"\r\n",
      "Presley Tampubolon, the head of Palu's disaster agency who oversees temporary housing, said the need for accommodation has been greater than anticipated.\r\n",
      "For every house destroyed or damaged, there would often be several generations of a family living in it. He said it would be \"inhuman\" to expect such families to fit into the 3-meter-by-4-meter (10-foot-by-13-foot) rooms that have been built.\r\n",
      "He said the government and aid groups have built temporary buildings with 5,300 total rooms that can accommodate nearly 41,000 people. But about 1,600 of those rooms are empty because they weren't connected to water, electricity or sanitation, he said.\r\n",
      "Hidayat, the mayor of Palu who uses a single name, said the central government has stopped building temporary homes despite the need and construction of permanent dwellings hasn't started.\r\n",
      "Compounding the problem is that the central government's social affairs and public works ministries haven't released \"mourning allowances\" and funds for people to build new homes.\r\n",
      "He said he's worried anger will soon boil over.\r\n",
      "The social affairs ministry's director of social protection and disaster victims, Margo Wiyono, said the ministry has verified 1,906 of the 4,400 names of heirs who would be entitled to mourning allowances and has proposed the finance ministry pay them.\r\n",
      "He said they were still investigating the rest.\r\n",
      "\"We don't want the allowances worth 15 million rupiah ($1,050) per heir to fall into the hands of irresponsible people,\" he said.\r\n",
      "The budget director-general at the finance ministry, Askolani, said it's in the process of approving money to pay the allowances. He said releasing funds for new housing is contingent on several factors, including reviewing local government data and identifying areas for new settlements that are safe from liquefaction.\r\n",
      "Hidayat isn't waiting. He said the Tzu Chi Buddhist Foundation has agreed to build 3,000 new homes in the Palu area, but he is urging organizations and local governments from around the country to build more.\r\n",
      "\"Our regional capabilities are very limited,\" he said. \"As the mayor, I'm begging for help to many humanitarian groups and institutions.\"\n",

      "Content:  437 WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) One match that wasn't played carried more significance than five that were in the fifth round of Super Rugby.\r\n",
      "The scheduled match between the Crusaders and Highlanders in Dunedin was canceled on Saturday by joint agreement in a mark of respect for victims of a horrific mass shootings the previous day in Christchurch.\r\n",
      "On Friday afternoon a lone gunman opened fire at two mosques in the South Island city and in less than 30 minutes left 50 dead and dozens wounded.\r\n",
      "Crusaders chief executive Colin Mainsbridge said players were shocked by the events which had taken place in their own city and \"all other issues and considerations pale in significance\" against the loss of life.\r\n",
      "Highlanders chief executive Roger Clark said the match a derby between teams from New Zealand's South Island is usually one of the biggest events on the Dunedin sporting calandar and more than 20,000 were expected to attend.\r\n",
      "\"But when we think about the massive loss of life and absolute devastation that has been wreaked on people in Christchurch, we feel this is the right decision.\"\r\n",
      "The match was declared a draw with each team awarded two points. With the champions out of action, South Africa's Lions and Australia's Queensland Reds staged second-half comebacks to win their round-five games.\r\n",
      "Gianni Lombard landed an 82nd-minute penalty to seal a 36-33 victory for the Lions, who rallied from a 33-5 deficit in Johannesburg. Flyhalf Hamish Stewart kicked a last-minute penalty as the Reds recovered from a 16-point deficit to win 34-31 against the Sunwolves of Japan.\r\n",

      "Events in Christchurch, an attack by a white supremacist on Muslims, have drawn new attention to the rugby franchise's name \"Crusaders\" with its connotation of a religious war.\r\n",
      "In a statement Sunday, the Crusaders defended the use of the name, saying it had no connection to the Crusades, the military expeditions organized in Europe from the late 11th century in which Christians and Muslims battled for sites in the eastern Mediterranean that were considered sacred to both religions.\r\n",
      "\"In terms of the Crusaders name, we acknowledge and understand the concerns that have been raised,\" the statement said. \"For us, the Crusaders name is a reflection of the crusading spirit of this community and certainly not a religious statement.\r\n",
      "\"What we stand for is the opposite of what happened in Christchurch yesterday; our crusade is one for peace, unity, inclusiveness and community spirit. This team and the wider organization are united with our community in standing against such abhorrent acts as that which occurred (on Friday) in Christchurch and in standing in support of our Muslim community.\"\r\n",
      "But since their inception in 1996, the Crusaders who have won the Super Rugby title nine times have used in their pre-match entertainment three knights on horseback who wear crosses, emerge from a mocked-up castle and ride through the team's Christchurch stadium brandishing swords.\r\n",
      "The cancellation of Saturday's match marks the second time a Crusaders' season has been severely disrupted by a tragedy in Christchurch. In February, 2011 a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck the city, devastating its central business district and leaving 185 dead.\r\n",
      "The Crusaders' home ground, the former Lancaster Park, was irreparably damaged and was later condemned. For the remainder of the 2011 season it played home matches at Nelson, Timaru and Napier before finally returning to Christchurch, to a new a stadium, the following year.\r\n",

      "Content:  438 PARKLAND, Fla. (AP) The communities and families terrorized by the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre will spend Thursday's anniversary visiting graves, packing meals for the needy and contributing to other service projects as they quietly remember the 14 students and three staff members who lost their lives.\r\n",
      "Victims' families say they will mourn out of the public eye. The Parkland school will be on a half-day schedule: Stoneman Douglas students will serve breakfast to first responders and will be dismissed nearly three hours before the time the shooting began, about 2:20 p.m. Many say they will avoid school altogether. Students at other Broward County schools will also work on service projects and observe a moment of silence.\r\n",
      "A ceremony honoring the victims will be held in a park near the school where students also will prepare meals for disadvantaged children. A nondenominational, temporary temple will open in neighboring Coral Springs, where half the school's students live. Visitors will be allowed to mourn, contemplate, leave mementos and write message on its walls. The temple will remain open until May, when it will be burned in a purification ceremony.\r\n",
      "THE FAMILIES\r\n",
      "For the victims' families, there is no day without pain, so while Thursday may cut a bit deeper, in some ways it won't be any different than the previous 364 days. The families remain outspoken in their demand that school Superintendent Robert Runcie be fired and against the reinstatement of suspended Sheriff Scott Israel, saying their inaction and mistakes allowed the shooting to happen. Still, most who have spoken publicly say they plan to spend Thursday quietly.\r\n",
      "Jaime Guttenberg's family, for example, will visit her grave, while Nick Dworet's will go to the beach where his ashes were scattered in the ocean. Athletic Director Chris Hixon's family is preparing for a race in his honor on Saturday.\r\n",
      "\"We are going to simply reflect and remember,\" said Tony Montalto, president of the victims' families' organization, Stand With Parkland. \"That is the best thing.\"\r\n",
      "Montalto's 14-year-old daughter Gina died in the shooting.\r\n",
      "THE SCHOOL\r\n",
      "Stoneman Douglas students will mark the tragedy by working on service projects. They can also receive mental health counseling and visit therapy dogs. Volunteers will provide massages and manicures. Security will be heightened at Stoneman Douglas and throughout the district. Maintenance workers will be kept out of Broward schools to avoid banging and loud noises that might upset students and teachers.\r\n",
      "Mickey Pope, the district's chief of student-support services, said the staff worked with mental health counselors, community groups, the victims' families and others for four months to devise a plan that they believe will honor those killed and allow students and staff to mourn.\r\n",
      "Many Stoneman Douglas students are skipping school Thursday. For some it's too emotional; others don't want to be in the spotlight.\r\n",
      "Jessie Frengut, a senior, said she and friends, including one wounded in the attack, are going to a farm to spend time with animals trained to comfort people with post-traumatic stress disorder.\r\n",
      "\"It will just be better for us if we do something on our own,\" she said.\r\n",
      "Alexis Grogan, a junior, said she'll spend the day picking up beach trash, dedicating her work to those who died.\r\n",
      "\"I survived something and I don't want to waste what I call a second chance at life because those who have passed don't get that,\" she said. \"We have to make a difference for them.\"\r\n",
      "THE TEMPLE\r\n",
      "San Francisco-area artist David Best began building temples honoring the dead in 2000 at Nevada's Burning Man festival after a protege died in a motorcycle accident. He has since built them worldwide, including in Northern Ireland for those killed in political strife and in Nepal for the 2015 earthquake victims. Like those structures, the Stoneman Douglas temple will be burned.\r\n",
      "This creation, \"The Temple of Time,\" represents the indefinite period it will take for the community to come to grips with the slayings. Best rejected naming it \"The Temple of Healing\" because he said that is impossible for the victims and their families.\r\n",
      "It's an Asian design with a spire roof that has intricate designs cut into it.\r\n",
      "\"It is a big, ornate structure that someone will come and put their faith in. I am the carpenter; I don't write the doctrine,\" Best said. \"Each person can come in with whatever they have.\"\r\n",
      "Best's regular volunteers 26 of them came to Florida from around the country scrambled last week to finish the approximately 1,600-square-foot (150-square-meter) temple. Community members donated their time to help.\r\n",
      "Plywood sheets and cedar beams were piled everywhere as the building took shape, meeting Florida's stringent hurricane code even though it will be burned before the storm season starts. Most construction materials and other expenses are being paid by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's public arts foundation, but neither Best nor his workers are paid.\r\n",
      "\"The initial reaction (people have) is, 'This is really crazy, why are you burning this? It is really beautiful.' But at the end of the period it usually makes sense to everyone,\" said volunteer Paul Walker, an English artist who now lives in San Francisco. \"The fire is very therapeutic.\"\r\n",

      "Title:  440 'RUN!': NZ shooting victims recount horror, mourn the lost\n",
      "Content:  440 CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) They had walked that once innocuous stretch of sidewalk side-by-side so many times. Every Friday, Yasir Amin and his dad had ambled along the path toward the mosque where they prayed together in peace, a routine so serene and so ordinary that Amin was nearly blinded by confusion when the man drove up with the gun.\r\n",
      "Amin and his father, Muhammad Amin Nasir, were just 200 meters from the Al Noor mosque on Friday when everything went wrong. They had no idea that a white supremacist had just slaughtered at least 41 people inside the mosque's hallowed halls, or that more people would be killed at a second mosque soon after. All they knew was that a car that had been driving by had suddenly stopped. And a man was leaning out the car's window, pointing a gun at them.\r\n",
      "\"RUN!\" Amin screamed.\r\n",
      "The bullets began to fly. The men began to run. But at 67, Nasir couldn't keep up with his 35-year-old son. And so he fell behind, by two or three fateful steps.\r\n",
      "Amid the blasts, Amin turned to scream at his father to get down on the ground. But his father was already falling.\r\n",
      "The gunman drove away. A pool of blood poured from Nasir's body.\r\n",
      "\"Daddy!\" Amin screamed. \"Daddy! DADDY!\"\r\n",
      "Amin had never seen anyone shot before. He left Pakistan for Christchurch five years ago, and was embraced by a multicultural city that felt like the safest place on earth. His father, who farms vegetables, wheat and rice back in Pakistan, also fell for the leafy green city at the bottom of the world.\r\n",
      "And so Nasir began making routine visits to see his son, sometimes spending up to six months in New Zealand before returning to Pakistan to tend to his crops. Nasir had been in town only three weeks for his most recent visit when he was shot three times on the street of the city he had adopted as a second home.\r\n",
      "From the ground, Nasir stared up at his son, unable to speak, tears running down his face. Amin ran to his car to grab his phone and called the police. Officers quickly arrived, and soon the father and son were in an ambulance racing to the hospital.\r\n",
      "Nasir had always been more than just a dad to Amin. When Amin was just 6, his mother died, leaving Nasir to raise him along with his four siblings. Nasir became both a father and a mother, a reliable source of laughter with a huge heart. He embraced Amin's new community of New Zealand friends as if they were his own family. And in turn, the community embraced Nasir so much so, that it initially confused him.\r\n",
      "The elder man was baffled by the constant chipper greetings of \"Hello!\" he received whenever he dropped Amin's children off at school. Why do they keep saying that to me? he asked his son. Amused, Amin explained that the locals were simply trying to welcome him, their own version of the Arabic peace greeting, \"As-Salaam-Alaikum.\"\r\n",
      "Amin chuckled at the memory on Saturday, one day after he brought his father to the hospital. Nasir remains in an induced coma with critical injuries, though his condition has stabilized. The bullets pierced his shoulder, chest and back.\r\n",
      "Like many other victims struggling to cope with the horrific events of Friday that left 49 dead, Amin made his way to Hagley College near the hospital. The college was serving as a community center for the grieving, and members of the public poured in with meals and drinks, doling out hugs and words of support to those in need.\r\n",
      "Outside the college, Javed Dadabhai mourned for his gentle cousin, 35-year-old Junaid Mortara, who is believed to have died in the first mosque attack. As of Saturday, many families were still waiting to find out if their loved ones were alive.\r\n",
      "\"He's very punctual, so he would've been there at a dime. He would've been there at 1:30,\" Dadabhai said, a reference to the time of the attack, which began soon after.\r\n",
      "His cousin was the breadwinner of the family, supporting his mother, his wife and their three children, ages 1 to 5. Mortara had inherited his father's convenience store, which was covered in flowers on Saturday.\r\n",
      "Mortara was an avid cricket fan, and would always send a sparring text with relatives over cricket matches when Canterbury was facing Auckland.\r\n",
      "\"The sad thing is he was actually due to come up to Auckland next weekend for a family wedding,\" Dadabhai said. \"We were due to have a catch-up. But I never knew a more shy, soft-spoken kind of person. ... As cousins, you'd kind of make fun of the fact when someone's so gentle like that, but he's leaving a huge void.\"\r\n",
      "The long wait for information on the status of the dead was particularly painful because Muslim tradition calls for burials within 24 hours of a person's death.\r\n",
      "Dadabhai said the community was trying to be patient, because they understood there was a crime scene involved. \"But it's hard, because until that happens, the grieving process doesn't really begin,\" he said.\r\n",
      "For some families, patience had worn thin by Saturday, and frustration erupted as they waited to find out the status of their relatives.\r\n",
      "Ash Mohammed, 32, of Christchurch, pushed through a police barricade outside the Al Noor mosque Saturday morning, desperate for information, before police held him back.\r\n",
      "\"We just want to know if they are alive or dead,\" he could be heard telling an officer at the barricade.\r\n",
      "In an interview later, Mohammed said he was desperate for information about his brothers, Farhaj Ashashan, 30, and Ramazvora Ashashan, 31, and his father, Asif Vora, 56, who were all at the mosque on Friday.\r\n",
      "\"We just want to know, are they alive or not alive so we can start the funerals,\" he said. \"The hospital's not helping, cops not helping. Somebody has to help get the answers.\"\r\n",
      "As Amin waited and worried over the fate of his father, he was also focused on trying to protect the youngest members of his family. He and his wife have so far tried to shield their children from hearing about the attack. But on Friday, Amin's wife briefly turned on the news and an image of an ambulance popped onto the screen. Their 5-year-old son immediately dove under a table, assuming there was an earthquake. Christchurch, no stranger to disaster, suffered a devastating quake in 2011 that left 185 dead.\r\n",
      "Though his relatives back in Pakistan now fret that New Zealand is too dangerous, Amin believes Christchurch is the safest place in the world. And he hopes that his funny, fiercely loving father will pull through, so they can immerse themselves once again in the friendly hellos and the peaceful Friday prayers they have long cherished.\r\n",
      "Like Amin, Farid Ahmed refuses to turn his back on his adopted home. Ahmed lost his 45-year-old wife, Husna Ahmed, in the Al Noor mosque attack, when they split up to go to the bathroom. The gunman livestreamed the massacre on the internet, and Ahmed later saw a video of his wife being shot dead. A police officer confirmed she had passed away.\r\n",
      "Despite the horror, Ahmed originally from Bangladesh still considers New Zealand a great country.\r\n",
      "\"I believe that some people, purposely, they are trying to break down the harmony we have in New Zealand with the diversity,\" he said. \"But they are not going to win. They are not going to win. We will be harmonious.\"\r\n",

      "Title:  442 Venezuelans find ways to cope with inflation and hunger\n",
      "Content:  442 CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) Francibel Contreras brings her three malnourished children to a soup kitchen in the dangerous hillside Caracas slum of Petare where they scoop in spoonfuls of rice and scrambled eggs in what could be their only meal of the day.\r\n",
      "Part of the tragedy of daily life in socialist Venezuela can be glimpsed in this small volunteer soup kitchen in the heart of one of Latin America's biggest slums, which helps dozens of children as well as unemployed mothers who can no longer feed them.\r\n",
      "Some Venezuelans manage to endure the nation's economic meltdown by clinging to the shrinking number of well-paid jobs or by receiving some of the hundreds of millions of dollars sent home by friends and relatives abroad a quantity that has swollen in recent years as millions of Venezuelans have fled.\r\n",
      "But a growing percentage of people across the country, especially in slums like Petare, are struggling to cope.\r\n",
      "Contreras's husband, Jorge Flores, used to have a small stand at a local market selling things like bananas and yucca, eggs and lunchmeat trying to scrape out a profit in a place where hyperinflation often made his wholesale costs double from day to day. Then he was robbed at gunpoint by a local gang. And his brother crashed the motorcycle he used to supply his stand.\r\n",
      "So Flores abandoned the market stall and looked for other work. He does some plumbing jobs and the family has turned its living room into a barbershop, sheltered beneath a corrugated metal roof held down by loose bricks and planks. It's decorated with origami-like stars that the family has made out of Venezuela's colorful but rapidly depreciating bolivar bills.\r\n",
      "\"Our currency is worthless,\" Contreras said. \"These days, I prefer trading a bag of flour for a manicure or a haircut.\"\r\n",
      "The scarcity of milk, medicine and other basics along with routine violence has eroded support for socialist President Nicolas Maduro even in poor neighborhoods like Petare that once were his strongholds. Maduro says there's an opposition-led plot to oust him from power and says U.S. economic sanctions and local opposition sabotage are responsible for the meltdown.\r\n",
      "Various local polls show he retains support from roughly a fifth of the population, many of them ideological stalwarts, government-connected insiders or poor voters dependent on government handouts, including the so-called CLAP boxes of oil, flour, rice, pasta, canned tuna and other goods that arrive several times a year.\r\n",
      "Contreras' family of four gets those boxes, but it's not enough to get by on for long. For months, they've been relying on the soup kitchen launched by opposition politicians as the main source of protein for their children. On a recent day, her 7-year-old son Jorbeicker played a pickup soccer game in the hilly, dusty streets in front of her home, while her husband practiced styling his mother's hair.\r\n",
      "\"I'm barely getting by,\" Flores said, scissors in hand.\r\n",
      "The four-day power outage that brought most of Venezuela to a halt this month added to Flores' misery. He wasn't able to use the electric clippers needed to give customers the sort of trims they demand.\r\n",
      "\"It hit us in a big way,\" he said. \"You absolutely need the clippers.\"\r\n",
      "The couple estimates the power outage cost the family the equivalent of $11 in missed haircuts a significant sum in a country where the minimum wage amounts to $6 a month, even if most people supplement that figure by working side jobs and pooling resources with friends and neighbors.\r\n",
      "Contreras and Flores charge 2,500 bolivars about 70 U.S. cents for a trim. A government-subsidized kilogram of flour can cost almost three times that, and Contreras says that lines for the rationed goods can be endless and she sometimes comes back empty-handed. She also said she feels unsafe in the lines. Dozens of people have been killed in gang crossfires over the years, and some have been crushed to death when lines of shoppers turned into stampedes of desperate looters.\r\n",
      "Next-door neighbor Dugleidi Salcedo sent her 4-year-old daughter to live with an aunt in the city of Maracay, two hours away, because she could no longer feed her. \"My boys cry,\" the single mother of four said. \"But they resist more than her when I tell them that there's no food.\"\r\n",
      "After walking back from the soup kitchen, she opened the rusty door to her home of scraped, mint-colored walls. Inside, her 11-year-old son Daniel, who was born partially paralyzed and with developmental disabilities, lay on a stained couch while flies flew over his twisted, uncovered legs.\r\n",
      "When she took the lid off a plastic container to show her last bag of flour, a cockroach crawled out, making her jump back and scream.\r\n",
      "\"This is so tough,\" she said. \"I don't have a job. I don't have any money.\"\r\n",
      "Salcedo used to sell baked goods and juices to neighbors from the window of her kitchen. Then, her fridge broke down and she couldn't find the money to fix it.\r\n",
      "These days, she relies on the kindness of neighbors, or asks a friend who owns a small food shop for credit while she waits for loans from family members in other parts of Venezuela.\r\n",
      "\"This country has never been as bad,\" the 28-year-old said. \"Just buying some rice or flour is something so hard, so expensive, and often, they don't even have any.\"\r\n",
      "A few days later, thieves broke into the soup kitchen and stole food. Then, a fire broke out in the slum, burning 17 homes to the ground. It was caused by candles that were apparently being used for light after a power outage an almost everyday occurrence in many parts of Venezuela. Opposition lawmaker Manuela Bolivar, whose Nodriza Project runs the soup kitchen, said that when firefighters arrived, they lacked water and had to put out the blaze with dirt.\r\n",
      "\"It's a social earthquake,\" Bolivar said.\r\n",
      "\"They lose their homes. They're left in the open air. The soup kitchen was robbed. It's so many adversities: It's the infections, the lack of water and food.\"\r\n",
      "At an outdoor market a short distance from Petare in the middle-class district of Los Dos Caminos, Carmen Gimenez shopped for carrots and other vegetables for a stew. When her 14-year-old daughter Camila asked if they could take some other products, she told her that they would have to stick to the basics.\r\n",
      "Although she has a job at a bank, she still struggles to make ends meet.\r\n",
      "\"It doesn't matter where you live. The need is the same,\" said Gimenez, 43.\r\n",
      "\"The poor, the rich, and the middle class we're all suffering somehow because the government has leveled us all downwards,\" she adds with anger. \"How did they dominate us? Through the stomach.\"\r\n",

      "Content:  443 KODIAK, Alaska (AP) After wrapping up a month-long shoot, a budding filmmaker is putting the finishing touches on a movie short produced on the Emerald Isle.\r\n",
      "Cameron Currin, a Coast Guard member by day and film director in his free time, said his film \"Kushtaka\" is inspired by a Tlingit legendary creature of the same name, which translates as Land-Otter Man. The film is also adapted from \"The Strangest Story Ever Told,\" a story written by Harry Colp.\r\n",
      "\"I wanted to make a film related to where I've lived for a while,\" Currin said. \"I did a lot of research about Alaskan myths and came across the otter man.\"\r\n",
      "Currin said the myth stood out, so he did more research on it, which led him to \"The Strangest Story Ever Told.\" Colp's story recounts how one of his prospecting friends, named Charlie, encountered a swarm of the creatures in Thomas Bay.\r\n",
      "\"I read the book and really liked it, and wanted to make a short film based on the experience,\" Currin said.\r\n",
      "Colp first wrote about the creatures in 1900; his daughter Virginia published the story in book form in 1953.\r\n",
      "The film is about 15 minutes long, has no dialogue and is shot in black and white in a tribute to the films of the early 1900s. An official one-minute trailer, which can be found at kushtakafilm.com, provides a foreboding musical track and plenty of up-close detail shots foreshadowing a less-than-desirable outcome.\r\n",
      "The IMDB summary reads, \"Based in the 1900s, a recently widowed prospector remains alone in the Alaskan wilderness during his desperate search for gold. Something has been stalking him from the trees. Can he find his fortune and leave Alaska for good, or will he lose the only real valuable thing he has left, his own life?\"\r\n",
      "Currin said his two actors are his wife Alicia Currin, as Margarette Driscoll, and Kodiak local Paul VanDyke, as Timothy Driscoll.\r\n",
      "Among those helping with the production were Kodiak resident Robert Wagner, producer and a makeup artist; Nick Dunson, set decorator; Fred Martin, production assistant; and C.E. Zacherl, art director and concept artist.\r\n",
      "\"A lot of people who helped were just co-workers or Coasties like me,\" he said.\r\n",
      "VanDyke said his experience participating in the film was positive.\r\n",
      "\"It was the first time I ever shot a film with someone else directing,\" VanDyke said. \"Taking direction from a director was a new but good experience.\"\r\n",
      "VanDyke said the teamwork with involved with the small crew was what made everything special.\r\n",
      "\"Cam is a great director and we have a solid team, so that's what made it special for me,\" VanDyke said. \"The guys that were helping with the behind the scenes stuff were a lot of fun to work with.\"\r\n",
      "VanDyke added that the black and white format brings something different to the table, beyond saving money.\r\n",
      "\"I like it because it puts the movie more into the film's period it's more like an old-time movie and it fits because it's a piece period,\" VanDyke said. \"I also think from a cinematic perspective it reduces some distraction of color and makes you focus on what is happening on the screen.\"\r\n",
      "Currin has some background in drama, having acted in middle school and high school. However, his experience in film was initially limited to playing around with amateur video making.\r\n",
      "\"I've always been attached to that creative outlet,\" he said. \"This is my first film to professionally make. I realized if I wanted to make films, I should start with a short.\"\r\n",
      "He added that he's always been a movie buff with a soft spot for horror and science fiction films.\r\n",
      "\"I used to watch a lot of the old SciFi Channel and the horror movies on it like 'Alien' and 'Gremlins,'\" Currin said. \"Movies like that were the golden age of sci-fi horror.\"\r\n",
      "The film took two years to plan, two months of prep work and a roughly a month to film and produce, with most of the crew volunteering.\r\n",
      "Production and filming were done between November and December. The team faced a number of memorable obstacles including the Nov. 30 earthquake on the first day of filming.\r\n",
      "\"That was the day when we first wanted to shoot and then we had that tsunami scare,\" Currin said. \"Luckily, nothing bad happened.\"\r\n",
      "Then, there was the challenge of shooting in a Kodiak winter.\r\n",
      "\"There were a few times when it snowed and we didn't account for it, as flurries came into the shot,\" Currin said.\r\n",
      "\"It did work out toward the end because the snow was intended for the final scene,\" he said. \"Having all that scenery from Kodiak makes it beautiful and stand out.\"\r\n",
      "In the end, he said the challenges were worth it.\r\n",
      "\"I always wanted to do it, and now it's down,\" Currin said. \"It's going to be really cool to see that work come to a close.\"\r\n",
      "Currin said he financed the film out of his own pocket, with a budget of approximately $10,000.\r\n",

      "Title:  444 Trump's move to send Haitians home goes on trial in New York\n",
      "Content:  444 NEW YORK (AP) A trial in New York over the Trump administration's move to cut off permission for thousands of Haitians to live in the U.S. is spotlighting emails between officials downplaying health and safety crises in the Caribbean nation as they tried to justify the change.\r\n",
      "The case centers on the Temporary Protected Status program, which has allowed about 50,000 people from Haiti to live and work in the U.S. temporarily since a devastating earthquake in 2010. The emails, filed with documents in the case, bolster the argument by migrant advocates that the Trump administration was so bent on ending TPS that it ignored the U.S. government's own research showing that Haiti was in no shape to take people back.\r\n",
      "\"The problem\" with that analysis, one Trump appointee to the Department of Homeland Security, Kathy Kovarik, wrote in an October 2017 email, \"is that it reads as though we'd recommend an extension (of TPS) because we talk so much about how bad it is.\"\r\n",
      "\"The basic problem is that it IS bad there,\" another official responded. \"We can ... try to get more, and/or comb through the country conditions we have again looking for positive gems, but the conditions are what they are.\"\r\n",
      "The non-jury trial in federal court in Brooklyn stems from one of seven lawsuits filed by immigrants and advocates over the 2017 moves to end TPS. The program has allowed about 300,000 people from Haiti, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Sudan and other countries to stay in the U.S. for years after their home countries were upended by natural disasters or violence.\r\n",
      "In October, a California judge hearing another of the lawsuits temporarily blocked the changes covering people from those four countries, forcing the administration to maintain their TPS status for now.\r\n",
      "But the Brooklyn case, which covers only Haitians, is the first time the administration's move to end TPS has been put on trial. U.S. District Judge William F. Kuntz said Monday he expects to issue a decision after both sides file written arguments in March. Whatever the ruling, it is likely to be appealed.\r\n",
      "Previous administrations periodically reviewed conditions in countries beset by war and catastrophe before deciding whether to grant, renew or expand temporary protected status, lawyers for Haitian migrants contend. But they say the Trump administration followed a very different path this time.\r\n",
      "The debate over the decision has turned on comments by President Donald Trump last year that the U.S. does not want Haitians and others from \"shithole countries.\"\r\n",
      "Those comments have come up in the New York trial, with the attorneys representing Haitians citing the remark but using the term \"s-hole\" out of concern for courtroom decorum.\r\n",
      "The judge, though, seemed offended by the omission.\r\n",
      "\"We're in the real world here,\" Kuntz told lawyers. \"Use the term. This is grown-up land and that's how we're going to roll.\"\r\n",
      "Lawyers for immigrants have argued that the comments show racial bias contributed to the decisions to end TPS. They have contended, too, that the administration failed to follow the usual practice of making decisions based on analysis by staffers at the Departments of State and Homeland Security.\r\n",
      "Instead, the lawyers said, Trump appointees rewrote or edited those findings to suit their purposes. In another email filed as part of the case, for example, a DHS appointee, Robert T. Law, wrote that a draft decision on Haiti \"is overwhelming(ly) weighted for extension (of TPS) which I do not think is the conclusion we are looking for.\"\r\n",
      "\"The defendants are entitled to their own opinions, but not to their own facts,\" one of the lawyers representing Haitian immigrants, Howard Roin, said in court.\r\n",
      "But lawyers for the government told the judge that the decision was the product of lengthy consideration and consultation, and reminded the court that TPS was always intended to be temporary.\r\n",
      "\"TPS is not asylum. It is not akin to having a green card. It is a temporary humanitarian response,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Marutollo said.\r\n",
      "Haitians living in New York testified they fear being forced to return to their homeland.\r\n",
      "\"It has been really stressful because we don't know how to plan our lives now,\" said Naischa Vilme, a recent college graduate who hopes to become a clinical psychologist.\r\n",

      "Title:  445 Gov. Newsom outlines priorities in first California budget\n",
      "Content:  445 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday released his first budget proposal, outlining $144 billion in general fund spending and $65 billion more from bonds and special funds.\r\n",
      "It kicks of five months of negotiations with lawmakers, who must approve a spending plan by June 15.\r\n",
      "Here's a look at what's in his plan:\r\n",
      "WILDFIRES\r\n",
      "The budget assumes that California will have to pay nearly $1 billion for last year's wildfires that devastated the Sierra Nevada foothills town of Paradise, among other communities. The $923 million is 25 percent of the overall projected cost, with the federal government covering the rest.\r\n",
      "It includes $31 million to make up for wildfire-related property tax losses in Butte, Lake, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, Shasta and Siskiyou counties. Another $19 million aids schools that lost revenue because of wildfires. Newsom also proposes to waive the local share of debris removal costs, saving counties $155 million on what is projected to be a $2.5 billion cleanup.\r\n",
      "He's proposing $60 million this year and next to improve emergency communications, and seeking a new fee on consumers to generate $170 million annually. Another $16 million would finish the California Earthquake Early Warning System.\r\n",
      "His budget includes more than $400 million to reduce fire-prone fuels and improve the state's firefighting ability. About half the money goes to forest management efforts, which have frequently been criticized by President Donald Trump. Nearly $8 million would go to create five California Conservation Corps firefighting crews and four Forestry Corps crews.\r\n",
      "HOUSING\r\n",
      "Newsom wants $1.75 billion to combat the state's housing crisis and $500 million toward homelessness programs.\r\n",
      "His plan would expand state tax credits to encourage more low- and moderate-income housing; build housing on surplus state property; and ease environmental protection laws to help encourage more housing. He proposes withholding money if local communities don't meet their housing goals or stand up homeless shelters.\r\n",
      "Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Housing Committee, called it a bold proposal to help overcome the state's need for 3.5 million new homes.\r\n",
      "But the California State Association of Counties objects to Newsom's proposal to tie transportation funding to new housing units. The association's Darby Kernan said it is concerning that Newsom would withhold critical transportation money when counties rely on private developers to build units.\r\n",
      "MARIJUANA\r\n",
      "The budget recommends a sharp increase in spending for cannabis programs. But it's an open question whether it will be enough to help steady California's shaky legal marketplace.\r\n",
      "It recommends just over $200 million for marijuana-related activities, more than a 50 percent boost from the current year. The state broadly legalized marijuana on Jan. 1, 2018.\r\n",
      "Income from the state's excise tax on marijuana is projected to be $355 million by the end of June, roughly half of what was once expected. What that means is a lot of consumers are still buying pot in illegal shops where there are no taxes rather than in licensed dispensaries.\r\n",
      "The courts budget includes nearly $14 million for resentencing of thousands of drug offenders whose offenses are no longer crimes since California legalized recreational pot.\r\n",
      "CRIMINAL JUSTICE\r\n",
      "Newsom says he plans to end California's current juvenile justice system \"as we know it,\" including by shifting the state's few remaining juvenile justice facilities from the corrections department to the Health and Human Services Agency.\r\n",
      "About 650 youth are in state lockups, down from more than 10,000 in the early 2000s. San Joaquin County probation chief Stephanie James, president of the Chief Probation Officers of California, said Newsom's proposal could imperil reforms made in juvenile justice over the last decade. Lawmakers have rejected previous attempts to send all juvenile offenders to county lockups.\r\n",
      "The budget projects $78.5 million in savings from a 2014 ballot initiative that reduced criminal penalties and requires that the savings be spent on rehabilitation programs. That's up nearly $14 million over last year.\r\n",
      "IMMIGRATION\r\n",
      "Newsom proposed expanding Medi-Cal coverage to immigrants who are young adults and lack legal status in the United States at a cost of $260 million. In California, people who can't prove they're legally in the country age out of full-scope Medi-Cal coverage when they turn 19. Newsom's proposal would raise the cutoff to age 26.\r\n",
      "The budget also includes $25 million for an immigration rapid-response program to help address the crisis on the border following the arrival of Central American migrants. It also includes $75 million for immigration-related services including legal assistance for college students.\r\n",
      "EDUCATION\r\n",
      "The budget includes a $3 billion one-time payment to California's teacher pension fund on behalf of schools to help districts that are seeing more of their budgets eaten up by pension obligations.\r\n",
      "Newsom wants $1.4 billion for higher education, including about $400 million for the community college system aimed at waiving second-year tuition.\r\n",
      "Newsom wants to invest $500 million in infrastructure to provide more childcare and $750 million for kindergarten programs. He also wants to boost a tax credit for families by more than a half-billion dollars.\r\n",
      "RESERVES, DEBTS AND PENSIONS\r\n",
      "The governor wants to set aside $13.6 billion for savings, paying down debts and taking a bite out of unfunded liabilities for retiree pensions.\r\n",
      "His proposal would use $4 billion to pay off debts accumulated during the Great Recession as the state borrowed from dedicated funds, including transportation accounts, to pay for general expenses. It would add $700 million to a safety net reserve account created last year to protect services for the poor during a recession.\r\n",
      "Newsom wants to pay down a chunk of the $257 billion in unfunded liabilities for retiree pensions and health care with a $4.8 billion payment.\r\n",

      "The federal government is partially shutdown due an impasse over one of President Trump's top priorities in office: the construction of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.\r\n",
      "But while thousands of federal workers are furloughed, the Trump administration is trying to press ahead with another top goal: increasing oil and gas drilling.\r\n",
      "The Post's Juliet Eilperin and I report that officials at the Department of the Interior have made a conscious effort to prioritize energy exploration during the shutdown, according to a top department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to talk frankly. \r\n",
      "When discussing what is most critical during the shutdown, we have looked first to executive orders, those things the president has made a point of giving us guidance and direction on, and secretarial orders, the official said. \r\n",
      "The Trump administration's decision means the oil and gas business, one of the most heavily regulated industries in the United States, says it has yet to feel any real consequence from the shutdown. \r\n",
      "To this point, we have not seen any major effects of the shutdown on our industry, Mike Sommers, president and chief executive of the oil and gas businesss chief lobbying organization, the American Petroleum Institute, told reporters Tuesday.\r\n",
      "The departments Bureau of Land Management, for example, has accepted and published 22 new drilling permit applications in Alaska, North Dakota, New Mexico and Oklahoma between the start of the shutdown and Wednesday afternoon. Officials said they did not anticipate any delays in the processing of either permit applications or requests for inspections of drilling operations on federal land.\r\n",
      "But elsewhere the department says it is not even accepting other sorts of filings such as public-records requests from journalists, activists and other members of the public made under the Freedom of Information Act due to the shutdown.\r\n",
      "It seems that the oil companies are getting services from the Department of the Interior when the public is not, said Kelly Fuller, energy and mining campaign director at the Western Watershed Project, an advocacy group.\r\n",
      "The department is also pressing ahead with its goal of preparing the Alaskan Arctic for more oil and gas drilling. The department decided to go ahead with four public listening sessions about BLMs push to define what activities can be permitted at the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska because doing so would help the scoping process move forward. The sessions, which were slated to wrap up before Interior stops accepting comments on Jan. 22, had been postponed because of the Nov. 30 earthquake that hit Alaska.\r\n",
      "The NPRA was one that jumped out as being one of those priorities, said the official, adding that only two to three employees were required to conduct the listening sessions.\r\n",
      "It remains unclear if the shutdown will stymie perhaps the top goal in Alaska for the Trump administration: opening the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. While the agency announced Wednesday that it would postpone meetings in Alaska and Washington to discuss a draft document evaluating the impact of drilling on caribou, polar bears and other animals there, it indicated the Feb. 11 deadline for public comments remained unchanged.\r\n",
      "The administration, along with Alaskas Republican delegation in Congress, wants to see sections of the refuges coastal plain leased before the end of Trumps term and a new potential president in 2021 has the chance to slow down energy development in the Arctic refuge. \r\n",
      "The push to press ahead with as many operations as possible marks a sharp contrast with how Interior, which oversees 1 in every 5 acres of U.S. land, operated during extended shutdowns under Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. The department is one of nine Cabinet-level departments hobbled by this partial shutdown.\r\n",

This is just one small statement that they should not continue to have undue influence over our decision-making over the existential threat against our nation, Inslee told HuffPost, which reported the governor is the third likely contender for the next Democratic presidential nomination to take the pledge, after Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.).\r\n",

      "Content:  452 On Wednesday the International Day of Happiness, according to the United Nations the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network released its World Happiness Report.\r\n",
      "The report ranks countries on six elements: freedom, generosity, healthy life expectancy, income, social support and trust.\r\n",
      "The top 10 countries tend to rank high in all six variables, as well as emotional measures of well-being, John Helliwell, co-editor of the report, told CNN.\r\n",
      "That doesnt mean that citizens of countries ranked high in the report walk around smiling all the time, but rather that they are able to push through in moments of crisis and sadness.\r\n",
      "What stands out about the happiest and most well connected societies is their resilience and ability to deal with bad things, Helliwell said.\r\n",
      "New Zealand, which ranked eighth this year (bested only by the Nordic countries, Switzerland and the Netherlands), is one such resilient country.\r\n",
      "The chapter on happiness and prosocial behavior in the report suggests that people seem most likely to derive happiness from giving experiences that provide a sense of free choice, opportunities for social connection, and a chance to see how the help has made a difference. \r\n",
      "But citizens in happier countries also say that they feel socially supported. Social support was one of the main factors for New Zealanders ranking so high in happiness. New Zealand is increasingly thinking about supporting well-being on a government, as well as individual or casual, level. In May, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that her government would introduce the worlds first well-being budget. She indicated that the budget would provide for projects to tackle climate change, digital transformation, social exclusion, poor health, housing and domestic violence.\r\n",
      "This sense of being connected and close to ones fellow citizens has been evident in the wake of the mosque shootings in Christchurch. Be it students performing the Haka or Arderns pledge to cover the funeral costs for the victims families and wearing a hijab in a sign of empathy and respect to meet with members of the grieving Muslim community, New Zealanders quickly came together to comfort and provide for one another after the massacre. In other words, New Zealand citizens everyday sense of closeness to one another and their desire to help one another also translated, in the face of tragedy, into resilience.\r\n",
      "After the 2011 earthquake and now the terrorist attack in Christchurch with high social capital, where people are connected people rally and help each other and (after the earthquake) rebuild immediately, Helliwell said.\n",

      "Content:  463 TOKYO (AP) An investigation by French prosecutors into alleged vote-buying connected with Tokyo winning the 2020 Olympics has raised questions about one of Japan's most powerful companies, the giant advertising and marketing agency Dentsu Inc.\r\n",
      "From its 48-story headquarters in central Tokyo, Dentsu is the exclusive marketing agency for the next Summer Olympics, landing that contract a year after the International Olympic Committee awarded the Games to Japan in 2013.\r\n",
      "The agency, which is Japan's largest advertising and marketing company, has helped line up a record-breaking $3 billion in domestic sponsorship deals 58 local sponsors and counting. That's more than twice the domestic sponsorship revenue as any previous Olympics, illustrating Dentsu's unrivaled business and political connections in Japan.\r\n",
      "\"Nothing happens in Japan without them. ... Nothing like it anywhere else in the world,\" former IOC marketing director Michael Payne said of Dentsu in an email to The Associated Press.\r\n",
      "In the French probe, investigators are examining $2 million authorized by Japanese Olympic Committee President Tsunekazu Takeda and paid to the Singapore-based consulting company Black Tidings and its head Ian Tan Tong Han. Black Tidings is suspected of channeling the money to Papa Massata Diack, one of the sons of the former IOC member from Senegal, Lamine Diack.\r\n",
      "Lamine Diack is also the former head of the International Association of Athletics Federations, the world governing body for track and field.\r\n",
      "Dentsu has links to both Diacks and is the IAAF's long-time commercial partner with a contract that extends through 2029.\r\n",
      "The elder Diack wielded enormous power with African IOC members. He was eventually suspended by the IOC, and then resigned his membership. He is also being investigated from covering up positive doping tests.\r\n",
      "The French believe the $2 million was intended to buy votes for Tokyo. They have also investigated a similar scheme involving the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics and alleged corruption by former IOC member Carlos Nuzman, the head of the troubled Rio Olympics.\r\n",
      "In an email to AP, Dentsu acknowledged it advised the Japanese bid committee about possible bid consultants just weeks before the vote. Tan was among them, and French prosecutors have suggested Black Tidings was a \"shell company.\"\r\n",
      "\"A number of consultancies made pitches to the bidding committee after which the committee contacted Dentsu,\" Shusakan Kannan, a spokesman for Dentsu, told AP.\r\n",
      "In a 50-page report by the Japanese Olympic Committee investigating the bid, it said the committee citing an evaluation from Dentsu decided \"that Tan was an extremely competent Asian consultant.\"\r\n",
      "It is not clear if Dentsu is a target of French investigators. A spokeswoman for the French financial prosecutor's office refused comment, saying she was not allowed to talk about details of the investigation.\r\n",
      "Last week, Tan was given a one-week jail sentence for lying to Singapore officials.\r\n",
      "A powerful IOC member, Takeda last week denied any wrongdoing in a Tokyo news conference. He acknowledged signing off on the contract but said he had no knowledge of Black Tidings' links to the Diacks.\r\n",
      "French authorities have not decided if there are grounds to charge Takeda.\r\n",
      "The IOC says Takeda \"has the presumption of innocence,\" although the probe is a stain on the Olympics, which open in 18 months. The IOC has called them the \"best prepared\" games in memory.\r\n",
      "\"As the case is ongoing, the IOC cannot comment further,\" it said in a statement.\r\n",
      "Kannan, the Dentsu spokesman, also cited the ongoing investigation in declining to give further details.\r\n",
      "He said Dentsu had worked with the IAAF since 2001 \"and we continue to provide services to support advertisers' marketing activities.\"\r\n",
      "Asked about Dentsu's relationship with the Diacks, Kannan said \"we have a contract with (the) IAAF, so we have had the opportunity to meet IAAF executives in business-related settings.\"\r\n",
      "The elder Diack is being held in France, and his son is reported to be in Senegal and has avoided possible extradition.\r\n",
      "Denstu is ranked No. 5 among world agencies by Advertising Age and is practically everywhere in Japan: in entertainment, advertising, television, marketing and public relations. Six of the Tokyo Olympics' 58 domestic sponsors are Japanese newspapers Asahi, Yomiuri, Mainichi, Nikkei, and Sankei. The Hokkaido Shinbum Press is also a sponsor.\r\n",
      "Akie Abe, the wife of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, once worked for Dentsu, one of the most coveted employers for young graduates. Dentsu also handles the account of Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party.\r\n",
      "Ryu Honma, who has written a book about Dentsu's role in the coverage of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami and subsequent meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear plant, called Dentsu \"untouchable\" in Japan's media. Honma is a former salesman for Japan's rival agency Hakuhodo.\r\n",
      "\"The reason that all the newspapers and media at large are not keen to put the word 'Dentsu' in their reporting, their articles, is the fact they are huge recipients of advertising fees coming via Dentsu,\" Honma said in 2016.\r\n",
      "Dentsu made unwanted headlines several years ago when a 24-year employee killed herself, saying her work life was unbearable because it included 100 hours of monthly overtime. It was not the first \"karoshi,\" or death from overwork, at Dentsu. The company is known for demanding long hours from its employees.\r\n",
      "In 2017, it acknowledged overcharging digital advertising clients by about $1 million.\r\n",
      "Jonathan Jensen, who studies sports marketing at the University of North Carolina, said Dentsu is legendary for its influence on the Olympics, dating back decades.\r\n",
      "He cited a case more than 30 years ago when Dentsu signed up Panasonic as an Olympic sponsor reportedly without the knowledge of Panasonic executives. Panasonic is still one of the IOC's major world sponsors.\r\n",
      "\"They (Dentsu) held so much sway that according to those involved, they committed them and then worried later about justifying the costs to their client,\" Jensen said.\r\n",

      "Content:  465 CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand   Almost eight years ago, the southern New Zealand city of Christchurch was rocked by a huge earthquake that killed 185 people and wiped out whole suburbs. Thousands of aftershocks kept the population on edge for months to come. \r\n",
      "Now, Christchurch is dealing with an entirely different kind of trauma. Fifty people were killed in two mosques here on Friday, sending shock waves through the city and the wider country not only because it was New Zealands first terrorist attack but because of the sheer number of those killed. The death toll far exceeded the nations annual homicide rate, which stood at 35 in 2017. \r\n",
      "It has rekindled memories of the last tragedy to hit Christchurch.\r\n",
      "Were seeing people being retriggered and feeling anxieties about all the uncertainties, said Carl Shaw, manager of Christchurchs Charity Hospital, which offered free counseling after the earthquake and has renewed this service in the wake of Fridays attacks. More than 30 counselors and psychologists are again ready to help people process the events.\r\n",
      "Were also getting a lot of questions about how to explain this to children, and from people who have watched the video and who regret it, who were traumatized by watching it, Shaw said.\r\n",
      "The alleged gunman live-streamed the attack on Facebook from a camera attached to his helmet. The social media company said it had removed 1.5 million copies of the video in the first 24 hours.\r\n",
      "Even first responders have been struggling to cope with the scenes from the mosques. There was a river of blood coming out of the mosque and thats a scene that you don't forget, said ambulance officer Paul Bennett, fighting back the tears as he described arriving at the Al Noor mosque on Friday.\r\n",

      "Christchurch schools went into lockdown after the attacks happened on Friday, with many sheltering in their classrooms until after 6 p.m. Being unable to go outside during all that time including using a bucket to go to the bathroom was traumatic for children used to short earthquake drills but not American-style active shooter lockdowns.\r\n",

      "Content:  466 WELLNGTON, New Zealand (AP) When the gunman began to attack the Al Noor mosque, Ahmed Alayedy scrambled to get to the nearest emergency exit. He was the first one there.\r\n",
      "\"I tried to open the door,\" he said. \"But it doesn't open.\"\r\n",
      "Alayedy and other survivors of the March 15 mosque attacks in New Zealand have described to The Associated Press a scene of confusion and terror at the door on one side of the main prayer room, in the first accounts of the role the door played.\r\n",
      "Alayedy said so many people began crushing him against the door that some of his ribs cracked. Another survivor, Khaled Alnobani, says he thinks as many as 17 people may have died trying to get out through the door.\r\n",
      "Investigators have likely examined a new electric locking system installed on the door in the days before the attack. The mosque says an electrician disabled that system the day before the attack, although some of those who escaped question whether that was the case. What is clear is that nobody managed to open the door that afternoon.\r\n",
      "With the gunman in the middle of the room, the door represented the only escape route for those on one side of him, at least until people started smashing windows to get out.\r\n",
      "Fifty people were slaughtered by the gunman at two Christchurch mosques during the attack, including 42 who died at Al Noor. Alayedy and others say that if the door had been wide open like it typically was during Friday prayers, many more people might have escaped.\r\n",
      "Shagaf Khan, the president of the Muslim Association of Canterbury which oversees the mosque, said the door was closed and latched much like the front door of a house. He said it wasn't locked, although worshippers may have believed it was in the confusion.\r\n",
      "He said an electrician had tested the new electric locking system on Thursday, and then disengaged it for Friday prayers. He said that to open the door, somebody needed to turn a lever. It was just happenstance, and perhaps the cool weather that day, he said, which meant the door wasn't wide open as usual.\r\n",
      "\"On any other Friday, the door would be open,\" he said. \"But on this Friday, nobody opened that door.\"\r\n",
      "He said he agreed that more people would have escaped if the door had been open.\r\n",
      "\"If it had been completely open, it would have been easy for people to get out,\" he said. \"But nobody was prepared for this. We were prepared for an emergency like a fire or an earthquake, and people would still have time to get out. This is something totally different. You don't put this in your emergency plan.\"\r\n",
      "Alayedy said that in the confusion, he can't be sure if he simply failed to turn the lever properly or if something else stopped the door from opening.\r\n",
      "Alnobani, said he, too, tried to open the door and it didn't work, and he's familiar with the lever. He said he believes the door was electronically locked. Simply pushing a button next to the door would have unlocked it, he said, but nobody knew about the new system.\r\n",
      "Khan said the mosque was in compliance with regulations, which require emergency exits to be clear from objects, easily accessible, and unlocked.\r\n",
      "Police said the scene examination is part of their investigation and they will not be commenting while the investigation is ongoing.\r\n",
      "Robert Wright, the Christchurch City Council head of building consents, said in an email the mosque was in compliance with the Building Act at the time of the attacks and had a valid certificate known as a \"Building Warrant of Fitness.\"\r\n",
      "Alayedy, 30, said that on the day of the attack, he'd been listening to a holy speech by imam Gamal Fouda when he heard six or seven shots. He thought it was an electrical fault at first but then heard screaming and ran for the door.\r\n",
      "\"All the brothers come in behind each other, on top of each other,\" he said.\r\n",
      "Because he couldn't open the door, he said, he tried punching the hexagonal piece of glass in the lower part of the door. When that didn't work, he drove his knee through it, shattering the glass, and then kicked it out. He crawled through and ran for safety.\r\n",
      "Alayedy, a chef from Jordan who moved to New Zealand nine years ago, said he thought about his family back at their house as he ran. His pregnant wife, his 3-year-old son, and the baby daughter they hope to have within the next couple of weeks.\r\n",
      "Behind the mosque, Alayedy said, he began helping people to escape over a fence but couldn't get over it himself because of his injured ribs.\r\n",
      "Another survivor provided a second escape route near the door by diving through a window with his arm wrapped around his eyes. Tarik Chenafa said he heard a tat-tat-tat-tat-tat and knew right away it was a semi-automatic weapon from his two years of compulsory military training in the Algerian army.\r\n",
      "\"I know someone is coming to kill us,\" he said.\r\n",
      "Alnobani said that when he first came to the mosque that Friday, he'd noticed the side door was shut and considered opening it but then saw there were some older worshippers. It was a little cold and windy outside, he figured, so he left it alone.\r\n",
      "Alnobani said he also managed to crawl through the door's smashed glass and run. He returned to help rescue a young boy whose father was shoving him through the opening, he said, and then helped the father as well.\r\n",
      "\"I tried to save the child, and I thought maybe I lose my life,\" he said. \"But I am just alone,\" he said, adding \"He had more than me to lose.\"\r\n",
      "When he tried to help a third person through the opening, Alnobani said, that man was shot. The gunman walked out of the mosque to get another gun from his car, Alnobani said, and began shooting at him when he returned. But he managed to escape, and then drove two injured people to the hospital.\r\n",
      "The gunman acted quickly, mowing down people on both sides of the mosque. On the side opposite from the closed door, some worshippers were able to escape, but the gunman also killed many others as they tried to leave.\r\n",
      "\"And he was actually standing behind them, and he was shooting and shooting and shooting and shooting,\" Fouda, the imam, told the AP after the attack. \"Tragedy. Tragedy.\"\r\n",
      "Brenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old Australian, has been charged with murder in the attack. His next court appearance is scheduled for April 5.\r\n",
      "Chenafa said he's still sad and confused, and finds it hard to sleep. And he doesn't know what to believe about the door.\r\n",
      "\"There will be a lot of waiting to find out the truth,\" he said.\r\n",

      "Content:  467 ADAMS, Mass. (AP) An Adams couple that was stranded in Haiti last month amid political unrest in the country is back in the Berkshires after making a harrowing escape past armed gunmen and rioters.\r\n",
      "Brenda Belizaire and her husband, Junior, had planned a two-week trip to visit his family in Deschapelles, a small town that is about 33 miles north of the Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince. But due to violent demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of protesters demanding the resignation of President Jovenel Moise, they had to extend that stay.\r\n",
      "At the advice of friends and family, the couple delayed their trip from Deschapelles to the airport in Port-au-Prince and rescheduled their Feb. 5 flight for two weeks later. They waited for the violence to subside, but instead it continued.\r\n",
      "Desperate for help, Brenda Belizaire contacted the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince. An official at the embassy told her that Americans citizens weren't being evacuated. She then called the consulate in Washington, D.C., and got the same answer.\r\n",
      "On Feb. 14, the Department of State ordered the departure of nonemergency U.S. direct-hire government personnel and family members posted to the U.S. Embassy in Haiti.\r\n",
      "The Belizaires decided they would have to get out of the country on their own. The same day as the state department order, the Belizaires boarded two motorbikes and began their trek five-hour to the capital.\r\n",
      "Because Brenda, 43, is a white American woman and stood out among other travelers, her husband believed it was best to have her travel discreetly as possible. In heat that climbed above 90 degrees, she donned long pants, sweat shirts and large sunglasses for the ride.\r\n",
      "\"We left all our luggage; we brought nothing with us,\" she said. \"If you look like Americans, if you're traveling like Americans it's just an invitation to be robbed, to be hurt.\"\r\n",
      "\"I was carrying my wife like a dead body. I felt so bad,\" said Junior Belizaire, 45. \"She is very brave.\"\r\n",
      "Every mile or so, they came across an illegal roadblock where heavily armed men in masks demanded money from them.\r\n",
      "\"They were actually threatening physical harm, wanting to take me or not let us through,\" Brenda Belizaire said. \"They're robbing everyone. You either pay the money, you turn around or they're going to take the money.\"\r\n",
      "The roadblocks have sprung up amid unrest in the country that stems from skyrocketing prices for basic goods and allegations of government corruption. While at first residents were simply blocking off main roads as a form of protest, as time passed and frustrations grew those roadblocks turned into illegal tolls where men began demanding money from anyone trying to pass, including locals, the couple explained.\r\n",
      "The demands varied from $5 to $50 at each roadblock, but when the men spotted Brenda the price tended to go up, the Belizaires said.\r\n",
      "\"(Junior) was worried that I was afraid. I wasn't afraid, I was angry,\" Brenda Belizaire said. \"I could support something that made sense. I am completely, 100 percent humanitarian and empathetic to people's hardships. But the fact that they were taking advantage of a situation, thieves calling themselves rebels for the cause ... you're just robbing your own people.\"\r\n",
      "Junior Belizaire, however, was afraid.\r\n",
      "\"Petrified,\" he said, looking down at his kitchen table last week, with donated goods that the couple plans to ship to Haiti piled high around him.\r\n",
      "During the trip to the airport, one of the motorbikes got a flat tire so the couple had to share one bike with a chauffeur for the rest of the trip. At times, when roadblocks appeared too dangerous, they got off their bike and traveled by foot off-road until they could be picked up again.\r\n",
      "Locals assisted them, along with other Americans looking to get to the airport, in how to avoid dangerous routes, they said. When they finally arrived in Port-Au-Prince, they checked into a hotel that was heavily guarded with armed security. They flew home the following day.\r\n",
      "It wasn't until the couple arrived in New York City and made their way back to the Berkshires that they finally felt at ease. \"I think the first time I could feel his relief is when we were on the train and we left Grand Central Station,\" Belizaire said of her husband, choking back tears. \"He grabbed my hand like super tight and he just had this look on his face like: OK, we're on our way home.\"\r\n",
      "The couple said they remain disappointed with the lack of assistance they had while caught in hostility in Haiti. Between rescheduled flights, hotels, roadblock ransom and missed work, the stay cost several thousand dollars. Brenda is a registered nurse, while Junior works in health care at a Berkshire nursing home.\r\n",
      "\"There are Americans on the ground all over the world who are not safe. I think, myself included, that you have this kind of falsehood in your mind that we're Americans, so no matter where we go, it's OK,\" Brenda Belizaire said. \"Let me be the first to tell you, that is completely incorrect. We are not OK.\"\r\n",
      "The state department said it is limited in what it can do to help U.S. citizens who are trapped in the middle of a foreign crisis.\r\n",
      "\"The Department of State and our embassies and consulates abroad have no greater responsibility than the protection of U.S. citizens overseas,\" said Marlo Cross-Durrant, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of State. \"We are generally unable to comment on individual cases, but the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince has been in contact with a number of U.S. citizens to provide whatever assistance possible under the difficult circumstances.\"\r\n",
      "U.S. Embassy Port-au-Prince is open for emergency American Citizen Services only.\r\n",
      "Crises abroad place a strain on embassy resources, making it difficult to assist with transport, according to the Department of State website.\r\n",
      "\"Security conditions can also limit our ability to move freely around the country,\" a statement from the agency says. \"It is almost impossible for the U.S. government to provide in-country transportation service to individuals or specific groups during a foreign crisis. You should therefore pay close heed to our travel and safety information for the country they are traveling to or residing in, monitor local conditions, and have a plan of action in case of emergency.\"\r\n",
      "An advisory from the state department warning Americans not to travel to Haiti remains in effect.\r\n",
      "The couple has kept in contact with family in Haiti, including Junior's two daughters, nearly every day since they returned. Some days are calmer than others, but hostility continues in some areas, they said.\r\n",
      "The impoverished country has had spouts of violence in the past, especially since the 2010 earthquake, but the unrest over the last few months is unlike anything Junior Belizaire has experienced.\r\n",
      "Still, he plans on returning for a visit in April, and Brenda will go back a few months later. They try to make three trips a year to visit family and bring donated food and supplies to communities.\r\n",
      "\"Haiti for the most part is a beautiful country. You're in the Caribbean, there's beautiful water. The people there are loving, they're welcoming, they're warm,\" Brenda said. \"But like anywhere else, obviously there are people who are not going to be accepting and there are places you'd consider not welcoming or uninviting.\r\n",

      "Content:  469 CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) Ahmed Tani settled in Christchurch as a refugee in 1999. After his escape from civil war in Somalia, the New Zealand city seemed a place of peace, a haven.\r\n",
      "Christchurch was more than just physically distant from the bitter strife he had previously known. With its leafy streets, vibrant gardens and green public parks, the Garden City as it is known was even visually a world away from the desolation of his war-scorched past.\r\n",
      "A teacher in Somalia, in Christchurch he first became a taxi driver, a choice made by many refugees whose qualifications are often not accepted in their new homeland. He struggled at first to settle in to a place so different from any he had known. But bit by bit he accepted Christchurch and it accepted him. It became home.\r\n",
      "That feeling of peace was shaken for the first time at lunchtime Feb. 22, 2011, when a magnitude 6.3 earthquake caused many of the buildings in Christchurchs city center to come crumbling down. People were trapped under the rubble and rescuers raced to save them in time. In the end, 185 people would die.\r\n",
      "For years after the quake, Christchurch was a city without a heart. Many of the buildings that formed its center had been destroyed or had to be demolished, and even its iconic central Anglican cathedral was partly collapsed. Schoolchildren who lived through the quake manifested higher levels of stress and anxiety than peers elsewhere in New Zealand.\r\n",

      "Content:  471 ST. CLOUD, Minn. (AP) A local assisted living community is making strides for the state of Minnesota in the world of memory care.\r\n",
      "The Sanctuary at St. Cloud is the first 100 percent-trained dementia-friendly community in the state, according to Cristina Rodriguez, resident engagement director for memory care.\r\n",
      "The Sanctuary opened in St. Cloud in January 2018. The facility has 101 assisted living apartments and 36 memory care apartments, according to Jean Werschay Reum, director of marketing for the center.\r\n",
      "Rodriguez, who has 20 years' experience working with individuals with dementia and their caretakers, facilitates the Dementia Friends program at The Sanctuary. Dementia Friends is an international movement brought to the United States by the Alzheimer's Society of the U.K.\r\n",
      "Minnesota was the first state to establish a Dementia Friends presence. Of the over 15,000 Dementia Friends participants in Minnesota, Rodriguez is responsible for a fair chunk, the St. Cloud Times reported.\r\n",
      "Rodriguez has trained every staff member at The Sanctuary through Dementia Friends sessions, which gives the center a unique distinction among other memory care facilities in the state.\r\n",
      "\"We do Dementia Friends first, then our dementia education. (Employees of memory care facilities) in the state of Minnesota have to do eight hours of mandatory training annually, and Dementia Friends is above and beyond that,\" Rodriguez explained. \"It allows all of our staff to understand what dementia is and what it isn't.\"\r\n",
      "Dementia Friends informational sessions aim to give participants a better understanding of how individuals with dementia are impacted by the disease and how they can take practical action to help support those living with dementia. Two upcoming sessions on March 19 and April 16 are open to the public to attend.\r\n",
      "\"One of the things that I like most about (Dementia Friends) is that it allows us to talk about a subject that most people still look at as taboo,\" Rodriguez said. \"Nobody wants to talk about dementia; nobody wants to talk about a loved one having dementia.\"\r\n",
      "But Rodriguez's Dementia Friends sessions aim to reduce the uncomfortable feelings that are associated with the disease.\r\n",
      "\"The goal is to help reduce that stigma. And a lot of people come in carrying that stigma with them because they've viewed dementia from the sidelines, and maybe they've seen it on a bad day,\" she said. \"That invokes fear, and with that fear comes trepidation. You don't know what to expect or how to respond, or what is okay to do or not to do.\"\r\n",
      "In each self-contained, roughly 90-minute session, Rodriguez weaves personal stories through important information regarding the types of dementia, the signs and symptoms of dementia, and communication tips for people interacting with memory care patients.\r\n",
      "One example of Dementia Friends programming is what Rodriguez likes to call the \"bookcase analogy.\" She challenges participants to imagine an 80-year-old woman standing next to a bookcase filled with her facts and memories.\r\n",
      "Factual information, like her name, birth date, wedding anniversary and so on would be books at the top of the bookcase. More substantial concepts, such as early learned information (like language) and emotions, are heavier and therefore shelved on the bottom.\r\n",
      "\"If I am that 80-year-old woman, dementia comes upon me like an earthquake, and so my bookshelf is shaking,\" Rodriguez explained. \"The books that are going to fall off first are the top shelf books, my facts. But my emotions and stories from longer ago are going to stick around.\"\r\n",
      "Rodriguez uses the analogy to illustrate what it's like to be a person with dementia struggling to recall seemingly \"obvious\" facts, like a spouse's name. If you were to ask that 80-year-old woman what her husband's name was, she would have to mentally sort through all the \"books\" that have been shaken up by the disruptive presence of dementia, a process that takes more time than if the \"books\" were properly \"shelved.\"\r\n",
      "\"Individuals with dementia are not ignorant individuals,\" she said. \"They're just not able to retrieve and retain information in their minds the same way relatively 'normal' individuals might be able to retain information.\"\r\n",
      "Rodriguez also explains that behavioral expressions of individuals with dementia like asking repeatedly for a loved one who has passed, or insisting they must leave immediately which can often be misinterpreted as \"acting out,\" are usually rooted in emotions and memories that are difficult for that person to communicate.\r\n",
      "Rodriguez said in those situations, it's important to consider one's communication style. How can you put yourself into their shoes to determine what feelings are associated with the behavioral expression you're observing?\r\n",
      "\"We don't argue. We don't reality orientate. We don't confirm if you're right or wrong,\" she said. \"(Individuals with dementia) give us such an opportunity to get a window into their lives. Oftentimes, by the time they reach placement, they're discounted by society, by their families. But instead of saying what is believable and what isn't, we say, 'Your feelings are true to you, so let's talk about your feelings.\"\r\n",
      "Since Rodriguez joined The Sanctuary in February 2018 and subsequently began teaching Dementia Friends, the response to the sessions has been overwhelmingly positive, if sometimes deeply emotional.\r\n",
      "\"Every single time that I've ever done a Dementia Friends session for the public, there has been at least one individual who is almost brought to tears, because it's very personal to them,\" she said. \"Most community members that have come in that I've had the opportunity to chat with really appreciate knowing how the symptoms change somebody.\"\r\n",
      "And the staff of The Sanctuary, it seems, appreciate the fresh take on dementia education.\r\n",
      "\"It's been very well-received by the staff,\" Rodriguez said. \"We have had staff that have worked at other facilities, that are not new to this kind of working environment, who have said, 'I have gotten more out of Dementia Friends than any other training I've done.'\"\r\n",
      "Rodriguez has also taken Dementia Friends outside The Sanctuary's walls. Local middle school students, police forces, EMTs and members of the general public have all become Dementia Friends through Rodriguez's tutelage.\r\n",
      "For Rodriguez, it's all about providing information in a way that's approachable, useful and deeply empathetic and so far, the Dementia Friends approach seems to be making an impact.\r\n",
      "\"It's nice for people to learn about dementia in a friendly environment,\" Rodriguez said. \"People walk away with an understanding that dementia isn't as scary as they might think it is.\"\r\n",

      "“Instead of requiring nuclear power plants to be prepared for the actual flooding and earthquake hazards that could occur at their sites, the NRC will allow them to be prepared only for the old out-of-date hazards typically calculated decades ago when the science of seismology and hydrology was far less advanced than it is today,” Baran said after the vote. \r\n",

      "Content:  480 OXFORD, England (Reuters) - Eight years after the Fukushima nuclear meltdown in Japan, radioactive particles collected from the site are undergoing new forensic investigation in Britain in an effort to understand the exact sequence of events. \r\n",
      "A 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck on March 11, 2011, off the Japanese coast, triggering a tsunami that killed some 18,000 people and the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. Meltdowns at three of the Fukushima Daiichi plant’s six reactors spewed radiation into the air, soil and ocean, forcing over 100,000 residents to flee. Many have still not returned. \r\n",
      "The Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) is currently collaborating with British researchers to learn more about the state of the radioactive particles created by the meltdown. \r\n",
      "Dr Yukihiko Satou from the JAEA oversaw the transportation of particles collected from within the restricted zone, very close to the disaster site, to Britain. \r\n",
      "“The particles were fundamentally extracted from those attached to soil, dust and debris,” Satou told Reuters. \r\n",
      "Encased in protective tape, the samples were brought to the Diamond Light Source, Britain’s national synchrotron, or cyclic particle accelerator, near Oxford. \r\n",
      "Here electrons are accelerated to near light speeds until they emit light 10 billion times brighter than the sun, then directed into laboratories in ‘beamlines’ which allow scientists to study minute specimens in extreme detail. \r\n",
      "Researchers have created a 3D map of a radioactive sample using the synchrotron, allowing them to see the distribution of elements within the sample. \r\n",
      "Understanding the current state of these particles and how they behave in the environment could ultimately determine if and when the area could be declared safe for people to return. \r\n",
      "The head of the team leading the analysis, Tom Scott of Bristol University, said the particles have a structure like a pumice, a very light, porous volcanic rock. \r\n",
      "“Studying... this glassy matrix tells us how available within the environment they are,” he said. \r\n",
      "The British and Japanese governments have awarded funding to the research team to examine larger particles closer to the site of the meltdown at Fukushima to better define radiation risk in the surrounding area. \r\n",
      "The research could have significance beyond nuclear accidents, the team said, because the techniques employed could also be used to image particles in air pollution to better understand the risk they pose to human health. \r\n",

      "Content:  481 TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo Electric Power has begun removing spent nuclear fuel rods from a second building at the wrecked Fukushima plant, using remote-controlled cranes to lift hundreds of radioactive cylinders from a highly contaminated reactor site. \r\n",
      "The company, known as Tepco, said on Monday that it had successfully removed the first of more than 560 fuel rod assemblies by 0051 GMT from the No. 3 reactor and placed it in a specially designed steel cask for transfer to the ground. \r\n",
      "The reactor was one of three reactors at Fukushima that suffered meltdowns after a 2011 earthquake and tsunami shut down the plant’s cooling systems. \r\n",
      "In 2014, Tepco finished the removal fuel rods from the No. 4 reactor. However, the removal operation for the No. 3 site will be much more difficult because of the damage it suffered in the 2011 disaster, with an explosion covering the pool where the rods currently sit in debris, including a crane. \r\n",
      "The damage and debris removal delayed the No. 3 operations for four years. Additionally, the highly irradiated air around the site means all the cranes moving the transportation casks carrying the rods, which weigh abut 45 tonnes, must be operated remotely. \r\n",
      "Tepco must pluck the brittle and potentially damaged assemblies from a flooded compartment on the reactor site that is 18 metres (60 feet) above ground level and place them in containment casks, raise the casks from the pool and place them on a truck on the ground to transport them to a final pool of water for storage. \r\n",
      "If the rods are exposed to air or if they break, radioactive gases could be released into the atmosphere. \r\n",
      "“The work is expected to completed in March 2021, but safety is our first priority,” spokesman Joji Hara told Reuters. \r\n",
      "The 2011 disaster forced 160,000 people to evacuate areas nearby the Fukushima plant, and many of them have never returned to the most contaminated areas. \r\n",
      "Japan’s government estimated in 2016 that the total cost of dismantling Fukushima, decontaminating the affected areas, and paying compensation would amount to 21.5 trillion yen ($192 billion), around 20 percent of the country’s annual budget. \r\n",
      "Even with the successful transfer of the fuel rods, Tepco faces other problems at Fukushima. \r\n",
      "Tepco has struggled for more than eight years with rising levels of contaminated water that comes from its jerry-rigged cooling system for the melted reactor cores, in addition to power failures and water leaks. Last year, Tepco said a system meant to purify contaminated water had failed to remove dangerous radioactive contaminants, setting back efforts to deal with the water that is piling up in tanks covering the site. \r\n",

      "Content:  482 TOKYO Japan unveiled Reiwa, two characters that symbolize order and harmony, as the new name for a new era under a new Emperor.\r\n",
      "The new name, carefully selected by a panel of experts and the government under strict secrecy, will be used as the basis for Japans unique Imperial calendar system after Crown Prince Naruhito takes over the Chrysanthemum Throne from his father on May 1.\r\n",
      "But it also symbolizes Japans hopes for the future in turbulent times.\r\n",
      "Our nation is facing up to a big turning point, but there are lots of Japanese values that shouldnt fade away, Prime Minister Abe told a news conference to explain the new name. \r\n",
      "The year 2019 will become the first year of the new era, or Reiwa 1, used on official documents, coins, driving licenses and newspapers, by businesses and in everyday life from May 1 in parallel with the Western, or Gregorian, calendar.\r\n",
      "The character rei can be roughly translated as order, while wa signifies harmony or peace. \r\n",
      "Abe said the new name conveyed a meaning that culture is born and nurtured when peoples hearts empathize with each other beautifully.\r\n",
      "While many people would use Western dates to think about international events, older people especially would use the Japanese system to think about domestic events and their own lives.\r\n",
      "Cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga unveiled the new name by holding up a framed white placard showing its two Chinese characters handwritten. The name, he said, is taken from the Manyoshu, the oldest anthology of Japanese poetry dating back to the seventh century, in a break from a tradition of using Chinese classics.\r\n",
      "We expect the new era to be widely accepted by the public and deeply rooted in the lives of Japanese people, Suga said.\r\n",
      "Many of the poems in the Manyoshu reflect the varieties of seasons and nature, and the character Rei is used in reference to plum blossoms.\r\n",
      "It is a collection which expresses our nations rich culture, which we should take pride in, along with our nations beautiful nature, Abe said.\r\n",
      "I want Japan to proudly bloom like plum blossoms, he explained. Plum blossoms bloom beautifully after a harsh winter as a sign of the arrival of spring.\r\n",
      "The name of an era, or gengo, represents the zeitgeist of a period, just as the Roaring Twenties and Swinging Sixties encapsulated different decades in the United States, or the Victorian Age is remembered by the British as a time of colonial expansion abroad and Protestant morality at home. \r\n",
      "It is carefully chosen as being relatively easy to write but not in common use, but more importantly encapsulates Japans hopes for the coming decades.\r\n",
      "The abdication of Emperor Akihito marks the end of his era, known as the Heisei, which means achieving peace. \r\n",
      "The Heisei lived up to its name as the first period in Japans history when military conflict was avoided, and Akihito is revered as a man who did much to restore the image of Japans monarchy but also to heal the wounds of war and promote a modern image of Japan as a peace-loving nation. \r\n",
      "But the 30-year Heisei era itself will be remembered less fondly it began with the bursting of Japans real estate bubble and was marked by decades of economic stagnation, when Japan was outpaced by its much larger rival China. \r\n",
      "It was also marked by political corruption scandals and natural disasters, notably the 1995 Kobe earthquake and 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown in Fukushima, as well as growing concerns about the effects of globalization.\r\n",
      "Before that, the Showa era that ran from 1926 to 1989 represents a turbulent period in Japans history, including its militarization and eventual defeat in World War II, followed by its recovery and stunning rise to become a global economic power.\r\n",
      "Japan hopes the new Reiwa era will allow the country to again turn the page and usher in an era of economic and diplomatic revival, beginning with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, just as the 1964 Games here represented Japans emergence on the world stage after the ravages of war. \r\n",
      "But it will also be an era when Japan grapples with an aging and shrinking population, and hopes to tackle labor shortages of workers by encouraging more women to work but also bringing in more foreign workers.\r\n",
      "After May 1, Emperor Akihito, who is 85 and the first Japanese emperor to abdicate in two centuries, will take the name of his era after his death, and will be known as the Emperor Heisei, just as his father, known is his lifetime as Emperor Hirohito, is now referred to as the Emperor Showa.\r\n",
      "His abdication, made on the grounds of his health and the weight of official duties, gave the government the chance to unveil the new era name a month before it comes into effect, to allow new calendars to be printed and software to be updated.\r\n",
      "The idea of Imperial eras comes from the ancient Chinese idea that the emperor rules even time itself. Japan has had 247 era names since the system was instituted in 645, but it was not until the start of the Meiji era in 1868 that a single era name has been used for a single emperor. \r\n",
      "Although widespread, the use of the gengo system is in decline. A recent survey in the Mainichi newspaper showed a third of people mostly use the system, compared to 82 percent in 1975. While 25 percent preferred the Western calendar, many use the two interchangeably, since both use Western months and dates.\r\n",

      "Content:  484 MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Chinese artist Ai Weiwei unveiled a new installation in Mexico that tells the story of 43 students likely massacred five years ago in a case that exposed government stonewalling and complicity in abuses, a frequent theme for the dissident artist. \r\n",
      "The installation features large portraits of the students made from a million multicoloured Legos that hover above a cavernous exhibit space, images that have become seared into the Mexican conscience by grieving family members who often hoist posters with the same images at protests demanding answers for their sons’ disappearance. \r\n",
      "Entitled “Reestablishing Memories,” the work also features a timeline of the 2014 abduction of the trainee-teachers from the all-boys Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers College in southern Mexico and the government’s widely disparaged investigation into the case. \r\n",
      "“Why do we have to do it? Because every crime creates a vacuum and it poisons society,” Ai told reporters at a news conference on Thursday. \r\n",
      "Known for his criticism of Communist-run China’s stifling of free expression, Ai said his latest project was partially inspired by the Chinese government’s refusal to explain its errors following a massive 2008 earthquake in Sichuan in which thousands of students died in government-built schools. \r\n",
      "“It reminded me of the Mexicans who lost their children,” he said, explaining how his own search for answers following the tragedy was stymied. \r\n",
      "An initial Mexican government investigation found that the Ayotzinapa students were abducted by corrupt police who handed them over to a local drug gang. The gang then killed them for reasons that remain unclear and burnt their bodies in a trash dump, discarding the ashes into a nearby river, it concluded. \r\n",

His analysis of the November 2018 general election shows the ES&amp;S voting system's deficiencies lead to significant errors that can damage election integrity and voter confidence.\r\n",
      "The problems that have been detected with the voting computers are the responsibility of the manufacturer, not the State Election Commission, which has upgraded the computers as instructed by the manufacturer, according to Buell.\r\n",
      "The voting computers used in South Carolina have miscounted the vote in recent elections, the LWV states. Although the manufacturer has recently upgraded the software, Buell found that several hundred votes were miscounted in the June 12 primary and November general election.\r\n",

The SEC is seeking a uniform, statewide system that features a paper record of each voter's voted ballot to replace the current paperless system. The SEC expects to implement the new system by January 2020.\r\n",
      "A new voting system will not only provide the state with a dependable system that will serve voters for years to come but will also improve the security and resilience of our election process. Having a paper record of each voter's voted ballot will add an important layer of security as it allows for post-election audits of ballots to verify vote totals.\r\n",

      "There is urgency if the state is to do better for the 2020 election.\r\n",
      "Even if all of the funding is provided this year, the earliest South Carolina voters would have access to new machines would be 2020 - and there is doubt as to whether they could be available in time for the presidential primaries early next year.\r\n",

      "The Savannah River Site's mixed-oxide fuel plant is being mothballed, leaving the national laboratory with 34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium, and there's little hope Congress will soon come up with funding to restart the Yucca Mountain disposal project in Nevada.\r\n",
      "The sad truth is that the United States has spent more than $17 billion trying to find permanent storage for some 90,000 metric tons of fissionable material or nuclear waste stored at 121 sites in 35 states.\r\n",
      "And it still has no place to go.\r\n",
      "Nothing substantive has been done in decades. A federal insurance program pays out about $400 million per year for nuclear plants to store spent fuel rods on-site. Worse, there's little hope the 116th Congress will even broach the topic.\r\n",
      "Why? Partly because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said she won't support restarting the Yucca Mountain project as long as Nevada's leaders are opposed to it, despite earthquake-prone California having plenty of its own nuclear waste to dispose of.\r\n",
      "Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., supports refunding the Yucca Mountain site there's about $40 billion in a fund for nuclear waste disposal but it's unclear if the veteran lawmaker can muster the political strength needed to get the issue on the agenda before he retires in 2020. The Senate rejected President Donald Trump's 2019 budget request for restarting Yucca Mountain.\r\n",
      "Gov. Henry McMaster and South Carolina's congressional delegation have been unable to persuade the administration to keep SRS's multibillion-dollar mixed oxide, or MOX, project going. Instead the federal government wants to dilute and dispose of the surplus at SRS for about half the cost.\r\n",
      "...\r\n",
      "According to Rick Lee, the head of the Governor's Nuclear Advisory Council, the MOX plant was set up for failure because of perennial underfunding that led to construction delays and added costs.\r\n",
      "The bottom line is that SRS could be indefinitely stuck with a huge stockpile of weapons-grade plutonium and untold amounts of other nuclear waste. That's unacceptable, and a betrayal of the federal government's promise to store the dangerous material elsewhere.\r\n",
      "The feds are now promising to move about a metric ton of diluted nuclear waste to a Nevada site by 2020, but Nevada's attorney general has filed suit to block it, even though the site would be only an interim destination.\r\n",
      "On Thursday, a federal judge in Reno declined to grant a temporary injunction the state was asking for and agreed to let Justice Department lawyers file additional arguments including one that would shift the litigation back to South Carolina, presumably to U.S. District Judge Michelle Childs, who is well-versed in the saga.\r\n",
      "S.C. Attorney General Alan Wilson, whose office has asked to be an intervener in the lawsuit, must continue to fight Nevada's challenge and, if the plutonium is not moved, pursue monetary damages under a law that calls for fining the government $1 million for every day it doesn't remove at least a metric ton of plutonium in the first 100 days of each year through 2022.\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, the National Nuclear Security Administration and Department of Defense have floated the idea of converting surplus weapons-grade plutonium at SRS into \"pits\" the fissionable core of bombs. That might benefit some laid-off SRS employees about 1,000 notices have been sent out with more expected later this month but it would do woefully little to reduce the stockpile. Pits require only a few kilograms of plutonium, and only about 40 per year are expected to be produced there, if ever.\r\n",

      "The only functioning U.S. disposal site is near Carlsbad, N.M., about 2,000 feet underground in a salt bed, and it's just a pilot project designed primarily for mid-level nuclear waste.

      "The attack has upended New Zealand's image as one of the world's safest and most tolerant countries. It also has highlighted apparent failings by security and intelligence services to view white supremacists as a real threat or to take seriously warnings from Muslim groups of a rise in Islamophobic and xenophobic incidents in recent years.\r\n",
      "Tarrant planned his attack on two mosques meticulously and had resolved two years earlier to kill Muslims, according to a manifesto he published moments before the massacre. He actively planned the Christchurch shootings for the past three months, he said in the manifesto posted online and emailed to the office of New Zealand's prime minister minutes before driving to his first target, the golden-domed Al Noor mosque.\r\n",
      "Police say they are certain Tarrant was the only gunman but may have had support and are investigating that possibility. He had five guns, two of which were converted into semi-automatic weapons. It's likely that at least some were legally purchased online from a Christchurch gun store.\r\n",
      "Possible links between the shooter and white supremacists in New Zealand's south have been alleged by recreational gun user and hunting guide Pete Breidahl.\r\n",
      "In a video posted on Facebook on Saturday, he said he complained in late 2017 to an arms officer a local police officer who monitors people's gun licenses about the disturbing behavior of members of a rifle club in the southern city of Dunedin that Tarrant reportedly joined.\r\n",
      "In the video and comments posted online, Breidahl said the club members had Confederate flags, wore camouflage clothing with rank insignia, vilified Muslims and had homicidal fantasies. He claimed to have met Tarrant, calling him \"not right.\" Police said they have no record of a complaint but are looking into Breidahl's claims further.\r\n",
      "Academic Paul Spoonley, who has extensively researched white supremacist groups in New Zealand, said they have been relatively quiet in Christchurch since a 2011 earthquake that forced whole neighborhoods to move and altered the city's demographics with an influx of migrant workers for reconstruction.\r\n",
      "\"They've been quieter recently but they haven't gone away. They are still here,\" he said, citing a 2016 incident in which pigs' heads were left at the Al Noor mosque, where 42 people died in Friday's massacre.\r\n",
      "A business owner in Christchurch has also attracted media attention since the massacre because his company's vans were emblazoned with neo-Nazi references including the \"black sun\" symbol that Tarrant's guns were covered with. The same images, which are used as the company's branding, appear on its website.\r\n",
      "When AP visited the registered business address, located in one of Christchurch's poorer neighborhoods, three of its vans were parked opposite, their \"black sun\" imagery removed but still identifiable by a company website address on them. A visibly hostile man standing beside the vans, who did not appear to be the business owner, did not want to answer questions.\r\n",
      "Police on Tuesday said they had arrested a 44-year-old man in Christchurch for distributing objectionable material and he would appear in court the next day.\r\n",
      "According to Spoonley, the level of hate crimes in New Zealand is low compared with other countries as is the number of white supremacists, but it's \"always a challenge to get people to accept that they exist.\"\r\n",
      "\"There's a reluctance to see equivalence between the risks presented by right-wing extremist groups and radical Islamic and leftist groups,\" he said.\r\n",
      "Neighboring Australia's white supremacist scene is more virulent, in part reflecting the history of its \"White Australia\" immigration policy which existed in various forms from soon after Federation in 1901 to as late as 1973. In modern times, the rise of a succession of prominent right-wing politicians starting with Pauline Hanson and her One Nation Party in the mid-1990s also legitimized such views.\r\n",
      "Spoonley estimates there are 200-250 hardcore white supremacists in New Zealand and about 300-400 people on the edges.\r\n",
      "\"I would be very surprised if Tarrant didn't make some sort of contact,\" he said.\r\n",
      "The groups, which emerged in the late 1960s, have evolved over time, coalescing for years around fear of New Zealand moving too far from its British roots, anti-Semitism and opposition to Maori sovereignty and Asian immigrants, and then shifting to Islamophobia following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S.\r\n",
      "Spoonley, who researched extreme-right groups in the U.K. in the 1970s, said when he returned to New Zealand in the 1980s he was told by authorities there were no similar organizations.\r\n",
      "But he quickly found more than 70 extreme-right groups, many of them in Christchurch. He attributes three murders in New Zealand since 1989 to white supremacists, including two that were ideologically motivated a South Korean tourist in 2003 and a homeless gay man in 1999.\r\n",
      "As Tarrant plotted more recently, Muslim groups in New Zealand were growing increasingly concerned by a rise in abuse against the community but say they were ignored.\r\n",
      "\"There has been an increasing trend which has been brought to the attention of the authorities several times in the last three to four years, including police,\" said Anwar Ghani, a spokesman for a federation of Islamic organizations. \"It was treated not so seriously.\"\r\n",
      "Verbal abuse, hate emails, hate phone calls and assaults that seem to have an Islamophobic and racist motivation, or a combination of the two, are among the hate crimes experienced by Muslims in New Zealand, he said.\r\n",
      "The country does not have an official hate crimes database, making it difficult to measure the trend, but some incidents have been widely reported, causing outrage but sparking no real official measures.\r\n",
      "Ghani said there are dotted lines between Friday's massacre, hostility to Muslims among a segment of the New Zealand population and the global rise of extreme right-wing movements.\r\n",
      "\"If the issue is not addressed in a proper manner then the problem will continue to increase,\" he said. \"They are getting bolder and bolder.\"\r\n",
      "Paul Buchanan, a former policy analyst and intelligence consultant for U.S. government security agencies, said the failure of intelligence agencies to detect Tarrant reflects politically based decisions to concentrate resources on monitoring the small number of Islamic extremists in New Zealand.\r\n",
      "\"My interpretation is that in the past 20 years and since 9/11 a political decision was made to prioritize detection and prevention of homegrown jihadists,\" he said.\r\n",
      "\"They decided to go whole hog, 80-85 percent of resources into detecting jihadists,\" he said. \"The rest was devoted to Marxists, environmentalists, animal rights activists. They went for the left.\"\r\n",
      "One such jihadi from New Zealand, along with an Australian, was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in November 2013 while fighting for al-Qaida.\r\n",
      "There was no political advantage in targeting alienated young white men seen by the wider population as mostly harmless \"Pakeha losers,\" a Maori word for white New Zealanders, Buchanan said.\r\n",
      "Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said the government will convene an inquiry into the intelligence and security services, seeking to understand why Tarrant was able to escape detection.\r\n",
      "Tarrant, according to Buchanan, may have been part of a small cell.\r\n",
      "\"There could be tacit enablers,\" he said.\r\n",
      "\"He was planning for two years,\" Buchanan said. \"To be able to do that in utter secrecy suggests someone had to have an inkling that the guy was going to do something and said nothing about it.\"\r\n",

      "Title:  487 Prosecutor: Drug maker pushed OxyContin despite danger signs\n",
      "Content:  487 BOSTON (AP) A member of the family that owns OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma told people at the prescription opioid painkiller's launch party in the 1990s that it would be \"followed by a blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition,\" according to court documents filed Tuesday.\r\n",
      "The details were made public in a case brought by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey that accuses Purdue Pharma, its executives and members of the Sackler family of deceiving patients and doctors about the risks of opioids and pushing prescribers to keep patients on the drug longer. The documents provide information about former Purdue Pharma President Richard Sackler's role in overseeing sales of OxyContin that hasn't been public before.\r\n",
      "The drug and the closely held Connecticut company that sells it are at the center of a lawsuit in Massachusetts and hundreds of others across the country in which government entities are trying to find the drug industry responsible for an opioid crisis that killed 72,000 Americans in 2017. The Massachusetts litigation is separate from some 1,500 federal lawsuits filed by governments being overseen by a judge in Cleveland.\r\n",
      "But the company documents at the heart of the Massachusetts allegations are also part of the evidence exchanged in those cases. While the Massachusetts filing describes their contents, the documents themselves have not been made public, at the company's request.\r\n",
      "According to the filing, Richard Sackler, then senior vice president responsible for sales, told the audience at the launch party to imagine a series of natural disasters: an earthquake, volcanic eruption, hurricane and blizzard.\r\n",
      "\"The launch of OxyContin Tablets will be followed by a blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition. The prescription blizzard will be so deep, dense, and white,\" he said, according to the documents.\r\n",
      "\"Over the next twenty years, the Sacklers made Richard's boast come true,\" lawyers in the attorney general's office wrote. \"They created a manmade disaster. Their blizzard of dangerous prescriptions buried children and parents and grandparents across Massachusetts, and the burials continue,\" they wrote.\r\n",
      "The complaint says the Sackler family, which includes major donors to museums including the Smithsonian Institution, New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Tate Modern in London, was long aware its drug was dangerous and addictive but pushed more sales anyway.\r\n",
      "A memo among family members in 2008 warned of a \"dangerous concentration of risk\" for the family, the complaint says. Years earlier, Richard Sackler wrote in an email that the company would have to \"hammer on the abusers in every way possible,\" describing them as \"the culprits and the problem.\"\r\n",
      "Joanne Peterson, who runs a Massachusetts-based support network for the family members of people addicted to drugs, said Sackler's comments show a \"blatant disregard for human life.\"\r\n",
      "\"He certainly hammered them six feet under,\" Peterson said. \"I've been to more funerals than I can count in the last 15 years.\"\r\n",
      "Purdue Pharma accused the attorney general's office of cherry-picking from millions of emails and documents to create \"biased and inaccurate characterizations\" of the company and its executives. The company said in a statement said it will \"aggressively defend against these misleading allegations.\"\r\n",
      "The company also stresses that its drug is approved by federal regulators and prescribed by doctors; that it accounts for a small portion of opioids sold in the U.S.; and that illicit drugs including heroin and street fentanyl are causing most overdose deaths.\r\n",
      "\"In a rush to vilify a single manufacturer whose medicines represent less than two percent of opioid pain prescriptions rather than doing the hard work of trying to solve a complex public health crisis, the complaint distorts critical facts and cynically conflates prescription opioid medications with illegal heroin and fentanyl,\" Purdue Pharma said.\r\n",
      "Messages seeking comment were left with a spokeswoman for the Sackler family.\r\n",
      "Massachusetts is the first state to personally name the company's executives in a complaint. It names 16 current and former executives and board members, including CEO Craig Landau, Richard Sackler and other members of the Sackler family.\r\n",
      "A suit filed by the New York County of Suffolk also names members of the family. A lawyer who filed that suit, Paul Hanly, said he expects the family to be named in further suits.\r\n",
      "Last year, Purdue halted efforts to market OxyContin to doctors.\r\n",

      "Title:  488 Nuclear industry pushing for fewer inspections at plants\n",
      "Content:  488 WASHINGTON (AP) The nuclear power industry is pushing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to cut back on inspections at nuclear power plants and throttle back what it tells the public about plant problems. The agency, whose board is dominated by Trump appointees, is listening.\r\n",
      "Commission staffers are weighing some of the industry's requests as part of a sweeping review of how the agency enforces regulations governing the country's 98 commercially operating nuclear plants. Recommendations are due to the five-member NRC board in June.\r\n",
      "Annie Caputo, a former nuclear-energy lobbyist now serving as one of four board members appointed or reappointed by President Donald Trump, told an industry meeting this week that she was \"open to self-assessments\" by nuclear plant operators, who are proposing that self-reporting by operators take the place of some NRC inspections.\r\n",
      "The Trump NRC appointees and industry representatives say changes in oversight are warranted to reflect the industry's overall improved safety records and its financial difficulties, as the operating costs of the country's aging nuclear plants increase and affordable natural gas and solar and wind power gain in the energy market.\r\n",
      "But the prospect of the Trump administration's regulation-cutting mission reaching the NRC alarms some independent industry watchdogs, who say the words \"nuclear safety\" and \"deregulation\" don't go together.\r\n",
      "For example, \"the deregulatory agenda at SEC is a significant concern as well, but it's not a nuclear power plant,\" said Geoffrey Fettus, a senior attorney for nuclear issues at the Natural Resources Defense Council, referring to the federal government's Securities Exchange Commission.\r\n",
      "\"For an industry that is increasingly under financial decline ... to take regulatory authority away from the NRC puts us on a collision course,\" said Paul Gunter, of the anti-nuclear group Beyond Nuclear. With what? \"With a nuclear accident,\" Gunter said.\r\n",
      "The industry made its requests for change in a letter delivered by the Nuclear Energy Institute group. A \"high-priority\" ask is to eliminate press releases about lower-level safety issues at plants meaning the kind of problems that could trigger more inspections and oversight at a plant but not constitute an emergency.\r\n",
      "The industry group also asked that the NRC reduce the \"burden of radiation-protection and emergency-preparedness inspections.\"\r\n",
      "Nuclear plant operators amplified their requests at an annual meeting in the Washington, D.C, area this week.\r\n",
      "Scaling back disclosure of lower-level problems at plants is \"more responsible ... than to put out a headline on the webpage to the world,\" said Greg Halnon, vice president of regulatory affairs for Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp., which says its fleet of nuclear and other power plants supplies 6 million customers in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.\r\n",
      "When the NRC makes public the problems found at a plant, utilities get \"pretty rapid calls from the press, SEC filings get impacted because of potential financial impact,\" Halnon said.\r\n",
      "Requests by utilities for rate increases also can be affected, Halnon said.\r\n",
      "Trump has said he wants to help both the coal and nuclear power industries. So far, it's the more politically influential coal industry that's gotten significant action on the regulatory rollbacks that it sought from the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies.\r\n",
      "In January, Trump appointees to the NRC disappointed environmental groups by voting down a staff proposal that nuclear plants be required to substantially and expensively harden themselves against major floods and other natural disasters. The proposal was meant to be a main NRC response to the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster after Japan's 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in 2011.\r\n",
      "Caputo, who previously worked for nuclear plant operator Exelon Corp, told operators this week her aim was \"risk-informed decision-making,\" concentrating regulatory oversight on high-risk problems.\r\n",
      "\"We shouldn't regulate to zero risk,\" said David Wright, a former South Carolina public-utility commissioner appointed to the NRC board last year.\r\n",
      "\"The NRC mission is reasonable assurance of adequate protection no more, no less,\" Wright said.\r\n",
      "Tony Vegel, a Texas-based reactor safety official for the NRC, pushed back when industry executives publicly made their case for fewer NRC inspections.\r\n",
      "\"It's difficult to come across as an independent regulator and rely on self-assessment\" from plants, Vegel said.\r\n",
      "The current review, commissioned by the new NRC panel, was looking at the inspections issues and related ones, NRC spokesman Scott Burnell said. Commissioners will decide after receiving the staff recommendations whether to adopt any of them, Burnell said.\r\n",

      "Title:  489 A congressman rails against undocumented immigrants as his estranged siblings care for them and other patients in need\n",
      "Content:  489 LARAMIE, Wyo. Three months had passed since Grace Gosar and five of her siblings decided they had to do something to stop their brother, a hard-line conservative and staunch defender of President Trump, from winning reelection to Congress. \r\n",
      "Their solution back then had been startling: Film a campaign ad for their brothers opponent.\r\n",
      "Grace, a 54-year-old mother of three, was battling ovarian cancer. The disease had taken a steady toll on her body, so much so that when she faced the camera that day and endorsed her brothers opponent, she worried that the remainder of her life would be measured in months rather than years.\r\n",
      "I couldnt be quiet any longer, nor should any of us be, she said in the ad, which cut to another one of her siblings and then another and another and another and another, all imploring voters to cast aside their brother.\r\n",
      "The Gosar sibling spots were played and replayed millions of times online this past fall, a symbol to many Americans of the turmoil in their own families and the myriad ways in which their country had never seemed more divided, angry and irreconcilable than during the Trump era.\r\n",
      "Nine-hundred miles away in Arizona, Graces brother, Rep. Paul A. Gosar, won his race by a whopping 38-point margin. Now, like so many Americans whose lives had been shaken by the countrys dysfunctional politics, Grace was wrestling with what came next. What did it mean to be a good daughter, mother, sister and citizen at a moment when her health and her country seemed to be unraveling? Some version of that question was still bedeviling all her siblings.\r\n",
      "Graces answer came on a frigid December day when she headed off to see patients at the Downtown Clinic, which offered free health care to anyone without insurance. She rubbed her head and neck, which throbbed with pain.\r\n",
      "She had spent 25 years as a rural physician until her disease forced her to give up her medical practice. She had decided to spend what she knew could be her last months attending to the indigent and undocumented in Laramie some of the very people targeted by Pauls uncompromising policies and harsh rhetoric.\r\n",
      "Her younger brother Pete, 50, served as the clinics executive director and needed the extra help to cover a growing patient load. Grace needed something to distract her from the countrys poisonous politics and the steady advance of her cancer.\r\n",
      "So she spent the day seeing patients who had no place else to go. It was approaching 9 p.m. two hours past the clinics official closing time and a couple of patients were finishing up with one of the clinics other physicians. A half-eaten chicken potpie, donated by some women from the local Methodist church for the staff and patients, was growing cold in the clinics break room.\r\n",
      "Hows your head? Pete asked.\r\n",
      "The same, Grace said. Its not great.\r\n",
      "She slipped on her coat and pulled a scarf tight over her face.\r\n",
      "Holler if you need to skip work tomorrow, he said.\r\n",
      "What am I going to do, sit at home? she asked.\r\n",
      "She pushed open the clinics heavy metal door and strode into the windy, snowy Wyoming night.\r\n",
      "It was difficult to pinpoint exactly when the Gosars political disagreements with their brother Paul became something larger and unbridgeable. Each of the siblings seven have publicly rebuked him seemed to have their own breaking point.\r\n",
      "The 10 Gosar children Paul was the eldest of seven boys and three girls were raised in Pinedale, Wyo., a small town dominated by the oil industry on the eastern edge of the Rockies. Their parents were devoted Republicans who attended the national conventions for former presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald Ford.\r\n",
      "Back then, the Gosars lives were dominated by sports more than politics. Four of Graces brothers played on the University of Wyoming football or basketball teams. Thirty years later, the Gosar Family Walk-On Award is still bestowed upon the universitys top non-scholarship football player. Grace was a track star, running 800 meters and the mile at the university.\r\n",
      "Most of the children settled within a few hours drive of Pinedale. Paul, attracted by the warm climate, started a dental practice in Arizona. But they all gathered for summer reunions at their parents home, a modest one-story house that sits on a lot scattered with broken-down campers, a rusted tractor and dilapidated snowmobiles.\r\n",
      "Dave, an attorney and the best man at Pauls wedding, was the first to cut ties with his brother following one of Pauls 2010 fundraising visits to Wyoming. Just before Paul left town, he mentioned that President Barack Obama probably wouldnt be eligible for a second term because he wasnt born in the United States.\r\n",
      "Dave was already peeved at his brother for ignoring him during the visit. Now he was furious.\r\n",
      "My exact quote to him was, Youre a f---ing birther? Dave recalled saying. You have got to be kidding me!\r\n",
      "A few months later, Paul, part of the tea party backlash to Obama, won his first election by promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act, cut government spending and crack down on illegal immigration.\r\n",
      "Grace accompanied their father to Washington for Pauls swearing-in as a congressional representative. Paul was more conservative politically than she had expected. But she held her tongue. It wasnt about me, she said.\r\n",
      "Over time, though, political arguments began to dominate the siblings summer gatherings. In the fall of 2015, Paul boycotted Pope Franciss historic speech to Congress because the pontiff planned to discuss the dangers posed by a rapidly warming planet. When the Pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, Paul wrote, then he can be expected to be treated like one.\r\n",
      "Pauls siblings drafted a letter condemning their brother but didnt send it after his eldest daughter, their niece, warned them that it would tear the family apart.\r\n",
      "Trumps rise led Paul to sharpen his positions, particularly regarding immigrants. He cited erroneous statistics to argue that recipients of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as dreamers, were prone to crime and accounted for 30 percent of all kidnappings in Arizona.\r\n",
      "He asked the Capitol police to deport any dreamers attending the State of the Union as guests of Democratic lawmakers.\r\n",
      "Of all the places where the Rule of Law needs to be enforced, it should be in the hallowed halls of Congress, Gosar wrote. Any illegal aliens attempting to go through security, under any pretext of invitation or otherwise, should be arrested and deported.\r\n",
      "For Grace and her siblings, the final break came in the summer of 2017, when white supremacists descended on Charlottesville, provoking a violent backlash that, police said, led to the death of a 32-year-old woman. Without evidence, Paul suggested in an interview with Vice News that George Soros, a billionaire investor and liberal donor, had funded the riots. He then falsely accused Soros, who is Jewish, of turning in his own people to the Nazis during World War II.\r\n",
      "This is a matter of right and wrong, Pauls siblings wrote in a letter published in the Kingman Daily Miner, a newspaper in the congressmans district. Our parents are 87 and 83 and we would be outraged if some sleaze did to them what Paul shamelessly did to Mr. Soros.\r\n",
      "Through his chief of staff, Paul cast his brothers and sisters as hate filled and urged them to return to the once-accepted norm that families, neighbors and countrymen can disagree without questioning the others character, integrity and motives.\r\n",
      "For now that seems unlikely. A few days before his siblings sent the Soros letter, Dave started a Twitter account for the sole purpose of denouncing his brother. If you had any guts or decency you would apologize for your despicable, anti-Semitic, loony tunes allegations, he wrote in his first tweet.\r\n",
      "As the months passed, Daves tweets grew angrier and more personal. Within a matter of weeks, he began referring to Paul as Weasel, a hated high school nickname.\r\n",
      "He really loves the name and it fits perfectly, Dave tweeted in December 2017. Your family despises you, Weasel.\r\n",
      "Some days, Dave relished the pain he imagined that he was inflicting on Paul, who he believed was hurting so many others. And some days Dave wondered if he was becoming a bully himself.\r\n",
      "I know from being a lawyer that when you are angry and you present that its not effective, he said. Its destructive to me. By this point, he had logged nearly 1,700 angry tweets.\r\n",
      "Grace knew a different version of Dave, and she was reluctant to criticize him for his tweets. Dave was the brother who had taken off work and traveled with her to Houstons MD Anderson Cancer Center when her tumors had stopped responding to chemotherapy and she was hoping for a spot in a clinical trial that might save her life. He helped her apply for disability.\r\n",
      "It was a few days before Christmas, and Dave was home in Jackson, Wyo., reading the news and tweeting. A federal judge in Texas had just struck down the Affordable Care Act. Cmon, Weasel, he wrote. Be happy that this decision might deprive your sisters of coverage for serious health conditions.\r\n",
      "Where Dave railed publicly against his brother, Grace headed off to the clinic to treat those who she believed were most hurt by Pauls policies. And where her brother told Paul everything he thought of him, she had decided to tell him nothing about her worsening condition.\r\n",
      "On a recent Thursday, the waiting room at the Downtown Clinic was filling with people waiting to see Grace.\r\n",
      "Pete was waiting by the front door, where he greeted each of the patients by name a small way he sought to remove some of the stigma associated with charity care.\r\n",
      "Before Pete was hired as the clinics executive director in 2015, he had been a social studies teacher, a commuter airline pilot and the chair of the states Democratic Party. In 2014, he ran unsuccessfully for governor. Paul had never asked to see the clinic, and neither Grace nor Pete had invited him to visit it. They werent sure Paul even knew they worked there.\r\n",
      "How is the sleep apnea? Pete asked Nick Beumer, 42, who came to the clinic four years ago with untreated diabetes and depression.\r\n",
      "Better, Nick replied.\r\n",
      "You look great, Pete said. Grace is going to be so pumped to see you.\r\n",
      "About half of the clinics patients, like Nick, worked part time and were battling severe and chronic health conditions. The sleep-apnea program, which had helped Nick shed 50 pounds, was Graces innovation, clinic staffers said. Through calls to hospices, she found families willing to donate sleep-apnea masks of deceased loved ones. Pete secured donations from a nonprofit organization, and one of the clinics nurses recruited a volunteer respiratory therapist from her church to help treat the patients.\r\n",
      "In its best moments, the clinic demanded a creativity that was more rewarding than a traditional practice. Its like solving a medical Rubiks Cube, Grace said.\r\n",
      "In its worst moments, the clinic revealed inequities that seemed absurd and even cruel. In the waiting room, a clinic staff member was helping a 36-year-old man fill out his intake form. The man, who had come in with his dog, had been a clinic patient for several years, but his background was hazy. He struggled to speak or read. His parents, he said, had been killed in a car accident.\r\n",
      "How often do you feel down, depressed or hopeless? the staffer asked him. He looked blankly at her. Do you feel sad? she clarified.\r\n",
      "He flashed a thumbs-up to indicate that he felt fine and after a few more questions headed back to the exam room, his dog trailing behind him.\r\n",
      "Out front, Pete greeted a 62-year-old man who had come to pick up his diabetes medication. Even though the temperatures had plunged into the teens, he was wearing only a Windbreaker and torn gloves. Pete pressed the man to go to the local soup kitchen.\r\n",
      "I only go if Im desperate, the man said.\r\n",
      "These men would never find jobs with health benefits, Pete and Grace knew. If voters and lawmakers spent a day at the clinic, Pete was sure they would demand a more humane system.\r\n",
      "They havent been touched by it, he said.\r\n",
      "By Petes reckoning, Paul was one of those who hadnt been touched.\r\n",
      "These days, though, Pete doubted he was reachable. There was a time, only four years ago, when their relationship wasnt so strained. In 2014, when Pete was making his long-shot run for governor, he joked in the Casper, Wyo., newspaper that his eldest brother was a conservative because he never had to wear hand-me-down clothes.\r\n",
      "Well keep working on him, Pete had said then.\r\n",
      "He is a good man, Paul had replied, back when their disagreements were merely over policy. He is my brother!\r\n",
      "Back then, whenever Pete was in Washington, he and Paul would meet for dinner or a drink. Pete didnt appear in the campaign ad with his other siblings, but he signed the 2017 letter calling on his brother to apologize for the Soros remark. Somewhere along the way he wasnt sure when he and Paul had stopped speaking.\r\n",
      "Initially, Pete said it didnt make sense to invite his eldest brother to the clinic. He didnt have time for desperate acts, he said. But, after stewing overnight on the question, he decided it was his responsibility to do everything he could to advocate for his patients. Theres nothing to lose, he said.\r\n",
      "He wasnt sure how Grace, whose anger was rawer, would feel about inviting Paul to the clinic. Maybe, he said, he would try to schedule a visit on a day when she was off. As of mid-January he still hadnt called Paul.\r\n",
      "In one of the ads she made for Pauls opponent, Grace was sitting in what looks like the hallway of a bustling hospital talking about the random nature of tragedy and illness and her own terminal disease.\r\n",
      "When I began in medicine I didnt believe I did not believe health care was a right, she said in the ad. I couldnt be but 180 degrees from where I started.\r\n",
      "A few weeks after the ad aired, Grace and her husband sold their home to pay for her care.\r\n",
      "Her insurance company, United Healthcare, had stopped paying for the infusions of the drug Avastin that were keeping her alive. First, they told her, the Food and Drug Administration-approved drug was not medically necessary, she said. Then they insisted that it was experimental and investigational. Now the company was saying she owed nearly $200,000 and counting.\r\n",
      "Sometimes she berated herself for crying at her fate because she knew that so many of her patients had it worse. There was the mother of three with advanced colon cancer. A few days earlier, Grace had been shopping at Goodwill for ugly Christmas sweaters when she saw a collection jar on the counter for the woman. The woman and her husband earned slightly too much to qualify for Medicaid. So, they took the money from the jar directly to the hospital to pay down their bill, Grace said, because they know if that goes away, shes not living.\r\n",
      "She thought of the 49-year-old man who had walked into the clinic one day earlier in torn socks and no shoes. He was several hundred pounds overweight. What he really needed was a surgical specialist to close the wounds on his feet. Without such care, his sores would just get larger and eventually doctors would have to amputate. Grace prescribed antibiotics the best that she could do for him for now.\r\n",
      "It was a Friday afternoon, and the clinic was closed to patients. The staff gathered around a folding table in the clinics makeshift pharmacy for its end-of-week meeting. Grace had been hospitalized one week earlier for surgery to open an obstruction in her kidney. She hoped the blockage was just scarring, but everyone surmises that its probably the cancer, she said.\r\n",
      "For now, though, she was healthy enough to work and planning her schedule for January and February. She spent her weekends with her husband and daughter in Buffalo, Wyo. about a four-hour drive away and her weekdays in Laramie at the clinic. She took time off for her cancer treatments and her daughters high school basketball games.\r\n",
      "Her illness, she said, had been a personal earthquake ... a seismic event where everything is interrupted and demolished at the same moment.\r\n",
      "You go from problem solver to a problem; from asset to liability; from well to sick; from financially stable to precarious; from a member of the community that is regard-able to someone who is forgettable; from thinking about a life when youre no longer available for your kids to doing crazy-ass things like driving four hours to work for something that seems like your only opportunity.\r\n",
      "She missed seeing her husband and daughter back home in Buffalo. But she needed the clinic. It was a place where she could still practice medicine, still do good and still fight back against the forces she believed were making the country meaner, angrier and more divided. Those forces included her brother Paul.\r\n",
      "I feel like its an affliction, she said of the alarm she felt for the country and the anger she felt toward her brother. What can you do but try to hold the line in the best way you can against the awful he represents?\n",

      "Content:  490 CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand The city has been here before, but never like this. \r\n",
      "Eight years ago, when it last experienced mass trauma, Christchurch was told it was experiencing its darkest hour. And back then it did seem impossible, with 185 dead and vast property damage from a massive earthquake, to imagine anything darker.\r\n",
      "But then came Friday, when a 28-year-old Australian extremist drove with guns first to one mosque, then across the city to another to unleash slaughter on a community just as it came together to pray, leaving 49 dead and 39 hospitalized, 11 of them in intensive care. It now seems clear that had the police not apprehended him just over half an hour after he launched his attack, he would have continued with his plan to inflict further carnage.\r\n",
      "[Lets get this party started: New Zealand gunman narrated his chilling rampage]\r\n",
      "The earthquakes were natural disasters. This is man-made, said a woman dispensing free tea, coffee and biscuits outside a Salvation Army church just along the road from the second mosque, where seven people were mowed down. She has pies heating in the oven for passersby. The urge to give and receive comfort is the same as last time, but the source of the anguish this time is not comparable.\r\n",
      "People drift past alone or in small family groups. Many have flowers to place outside a police cordon that blocks traffic around the crime scene. The blockade is merely a delicate flutter of plastic tape, a police car and two policemen bearing unusually in this country guns.\r\n",
      "Christchurch residents know from that earlier darkest day the value of small gestures: hot food from a stranger, a smile of solidarity, a gentle word. They learned last time to be liberal with hugs, with friends as well as with people they barely knew. They are hugging again.\r\n",
      "The city was quiet Saturday. Many shops remained closed. Hagley Park, the green lungs of the city, would on a normal fall Saturday be a kaleidoscope of kids and adults playing sports, runners, walkers and people whizzing by on electric scooters. It has been mostly empty since schools and clubs suspended activities out of concern for security and respect for the dead.\r\n",
      "The mosque on Deans Avenue, the gunmans first target, sits opposite the park, guarded from public view by more plastic tape and four or five armed constables. Pedestrians flow by in a light stream, pausing to stand in disbelief and shock, write on a giant plastic condolence sheet and lay flowers. No one speaks above a whisper.\r\n",
      "Some have reached for normalcy as an expression of solidarity. At Scorpio Books, a much-loved 40-year-old institution in the city, store manager Kit Lyall has put a chalkboard out front with a message: Kia kaha tautahi Stay strong, Christchurch in the language of New Zealands first people, the Maori. The store is collecting contributions to help the victims and their families and has set up a display of books that might help ease the citys sadness.\r\n",
      "In the hours after the massacre, Lyall and her staff shielded children who had been ordered to leave the 2,000-strong school climate strike held in the citys Cathedral Square, a block away. Police cleared the square shortly after 2 p.m. about 20 minutes after the first shots were fired. Teachers were told only that there had been a firearms incident and that their schools were in lockdown. Lyall and her staff dispensed tea and WiFi passwords until the children were released.\r\n",
      "Im used to this, said Lyall, an American who has been here for three years. I went into crisis management mode. The difference here is how New Zealand has reacted calling it a terrorist attack immediately, and already they are talking in Parliament about the gun laws.\r\n",
      "No public vigil has yet been planned the police have warned against large gatherings for now. The mayor, Lianne Dalziel a former Labour member of Parliament whose tenure has been dominated by the politics of earthquake recovery told people to do the things they already know are vital to community well-being. Reach out to neighbors. Organize get-togethers, and reflect on what has happened and how important neighborhoods are. Thats what got us through the earthquakes, and thats what will get us through this tragedy.\r\n",
      "To the extent that people were gathering Saturday, it was at Hagley Community College, a large, liberal, multicultural school next to Hagley Park. There, the Muslim community is waiting to find out who died and who survived, and struggling with the monumental task of burying so many in a way that is consistent with their faith and that allows the investigative process to take its course.\r\n",
      "[Among New Zealand mosque victims: Parents, children and refugees]\r\n",
      "Shuja Rehman, a 32-year-old electrical engineer, has come from Hagley College to the central police station to report his cousin, Syed Areeb Ahmed, as a missing person. Syed hasnt been heard from since the assault began at the Deans Avenue mosque, where he had gone to pray. Shuja would have been there himself if he had not been delayed for a few minutes by a phone call. He heard the shots as he made his way along the street to the mosque. He has a friend who survived only because he was covered by the bodies of others. He fears the worst for his cousin.\r\n",
      "Shuja and Syed came to New Zealand from Pakistan as skilled migrants Shuja has been here three years, Syed about 18 months.\r\n",
      "New Zealands prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, says the slaughter carried out Friday is not the New Zealand that this community knows, referring to the Muslims. And it is true that New Zealand has, until now, been largely free of terrorism and organized political hatred. Many here say they want to believe New Zealanders are collectively resilient to the kind of politics they observe, with abhorrence, in the United States.\r\n",
      "The killer was Australian, many note, not someone born and bred here.\r\n",
      "But Shuja suggested he has seen a less innocent side of New Zealand, describing casual racism and contempt directed his way at his workplace.\r\n",
      "Oh, youre from Pakistan, you must be a terrorist, he said one colleague told him in his first week at work. He said he has been the butt of puerile generalizations about Islam and has colleagues who have openly mocked the rituals of Muslim prayer. He noted that as a nation, New Zealand has learned to celebrate Lunar New Year, Diwali and other ethnic festivals but not Eid.\r\n",
      "He chose New Zealand over Australia as a place to build a new life, because this country seemed free of the racism he heard was prevalent across the Tasman Sea in Australia. Yet he has discovered, he said, that strangers here are willing to denigrate his faith and ridicule his community.\r\n",
      "We have not been speaking up, he said as he waited to find out if his cousin was dead or alive, so that he could inform Syeds desperate parents in Pakistan. From now on, I will raise my voice.\r\n",

      "Content:  491 CANAAN, Haiti (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - On a street of rocks and white dust in the center of one of the world’s newest cities, Alisma Robert pointed to an array of electric cabling strung between rickety wooden poles. \r\n",
      "“It wasn’t EDH that built that pole,” said Robert, referring to Haiti’s national electricity provider. \r\n",
      "“It was us.” \r\n",
      "Nearly everything in the city of Canaan, which was founded in 2010 after a catastrophic earthquake, was built by residents without government help. \r\n",
      "After waiting two years for electricity, Robert and his neighbors collected money from each household, erected the wooden poles, and wired up the cables to the house of a family who were connected to the grid. \r\n",
      "“I’m a citizen - but not for the moment. I don’t have the benefits of a citizen. We don’t have drinkable water ... No public toilets. The government doesn’t do anything for the people who live here.” \r\n",
      "Nearby, his wife sat at a rickety table selling bread and bags of sugar. Few people came to buy. \r\n",
      "“I don’t have work,” said the 52-year-old former teacher. \r\n",
      "NINE YEARS ON \r\n",
      "Robert lost his job nine years ago when the earthquake destroyed the elementary school where he worked. The 7.0-magnitude quake that hit on January 12, 2010 leveled much of the capital Port-au-Prince and left 1.5 million Haitians homeless. \r\n",
      "Estimates of the number of people killed vary widely - from 46,000 dead to as many as 316,000. \r\n",
      "In the aftermath, international agencies helped relocate some homeless families to empty land 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of the capital. Others flocked there, and within months thousands had claimed plots. \r\n",
      "At first, most lived in shacks or under tarpaulins, but eventually many laid concrete blocks for the foundations of their future homes and businesses. They planted fruit trees and they grazed goats. \r\n",
      "Called Canaan, it has grown from a population near zero to about 300,000. \r\n",
      "A few months after the earthquake, then-President Rene Preval expropriated the land for the state. To date, though, the state has not identified the previous owners or compensated them. Since the expropriation, several businesses and individuals have claimed they were the rightful owners. \r\n",
      "The law requires that the state identify the owners and pay compensation if necessary, said Leslie Voltaire, a Haitian architect and urban planner who has consulted for the government about Canaan. \r\n",
      "However, Voltaire personally believes the land does now belong to the state, so it “should be able to do a cadastre there and give land title”. That has not happened. \r\n",
      "The ministry responsible declined a request for an on-the-record interview to discuss the land titling issue in Canaan. \r\n",
      "The spokesman for the office of the president did not respond to an interview request. \r\n",
      "‘DELICATE SITUATION’ \r\n",
      "Without title, residents risk losing any investment they make and cannot use their property as collateral. \r\n",
      "“After I have my document, I can invest here,” Robert said. \r\n",
      "“I could do anything I want - sell food, sell phone credit. Start a hardware store. But no one is legalized here.” \r\n",
      "The head of the post-earthquake reconstruction office, Clement Belizaire, warned that without security of tenure this largely self-governed city could become a slum where land barons filled the void. \r\n",
      "“This is a very delicate situation where the government has not yet compensated or officially identified owners. There’s a lot that needs to be put in order to make this viable,” he said. \r\n",
      "The first requirement would be formalizing settlements - identifying plots and giving residents the chance to register them, he said. \r\n",
      "After that, the state could levy taxes - which residents say they want to pay in order to formalize their rights. \r\n",
      "“It’s our land. We’ve lived on it - for more than eight years. But we have no papers. If we die, there’s nothing to say our children get to have this,” said resident Etienne Manoly. \r\n",
      "Paying taxes would obligate the state to provide roads, electricity, water, schools, hospitals - and, above all, security. \r\n",
      "“We have many needs from the central state,” said Manoly. \r\n",
      "TAX AND SPEND \r\n",
      "The need for tax revenues saw the American Red Cross (ARC) fund an assessment in 2017 and 2018 of about a quarter of the estimated 40,000 homes and shops in Canaan. It handed that data to the government so that nearby municipalities could levy taxes and invest that revenue into community projects. \r\n",
      "Yet it remains to be seen whether municipal authorities will allocate money from their budgets to survey the rest of Canaan’s structures - although a representative from the nearby city of Croix-des-Bouquets said it had begun doing so. \r\n",
      "One solution to the land dispute would be for the original landowners to seek payment from residents, with the government acting as a broker, said Louis Jadotte, a former UN-Habitat consultant in Canaan - although establishing ownership in a 300,000-strong city would be a huge undertaking. \r\n",
      "Meantime, experts from the United Nations and the ARC said the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) would be well-placed in assisting to raise tax revenues. \r\n",
      "Between 2013 and 2018, USAID - through its LOKAL+ program - helped nine Haitian municipalities boost their tax take by 17 percent on average. One of those was Port-au-Prince’s Delmas district, which expanded its tax base: it has since rebuilt roads and pavements destroyed in the quake. \r\n",
      "“Now all those roads are paved,” said Anna Konotchick, the former program manager for Canaan for the ARC, one of the leading NGOs working there after the earthquake. \r\n",
      "But recognizing people’s properties in order to tax them is not the same as granting permanent deeds that would legally secure their tenure, said Jadotte. \r\n",
      "Tax-related documents might just state that the municipality recognizes the person is “occupying” that place and has built a certain structure on it, and that they are “paying their fair share in the form of government taxes or fees,”, he said. \r\n",
      "Even if USAID did fund a LOKAL+ project in Canaan, he said, its residents might still be seen as illegal squatters in the government’s eyes until it decided to address the underlying issue of ownership. \r\n",
      "“Land rights are not a black and white thing - it’s a continuum. And you can move it from uncertainty toward security - papers that say you’re the full owner.” \r\n",
      "And at least one institution does not like the idea of USAID being involved: Haiti’s inter-ministerial land office, CIAT. \r\n",
      "For the U.S. government to take part in a program to tax Haitian citizens was “against democracy”, said CIAT head Michele Oriol. \r\n",
      "And, she insisted, Haiti’s institutions were up to the task. \r\n",
      "“But we have to do it systematically.” \r\n",
      "‘NO MORE SPACE’ \r\n",
      "The land underneath Canaan was once slated for development as an industrial park to manufacture and export goods. That did not happen. \r\n",
      "Today - having sat vacant for decades - it is home to hundreds of thousands of people. More still come seeking land, said Robert of his neighborhood, Canaan 3. \r\n",
      "“But they don’t find - there is no more space.” \r\n",
      "One family asked to buy the 10-by-15-foot patch of front yard that is covered with rocks to lay the foundation for a second home to house some of his eight children. He told them no, “because I have kids and they will need it”. \r\n",
      "“Canaan cannot become a desert,” Robert said, in reference to the state’s lack of involvement. \r\n",
      "“The history of the people of Israel - Moses led them through the desert. He took them out of slavery,” he said. \r\n",
      "“It’s the same for me - it’s from slavery that I left,” he said, referring to landlords to whom he was indebted in Port-au-Prince before the earthquake. \r\n",
      "And so, come what may, Robert is determined he will not go back to the capital. Instead, he plans to live out his days in Canaan, waiting for the government to give him the security of tenure that he says the people of this new city deserve. \r\n",

      "Content:  492 YOKOHAMA, Japan Toshiba Corp. unveiled a remote-controlled robot with tongs on Monday that it hopes will be able to probe the inside of one of the three damaged reactors at Japans tsunami-hit Fukushima nuclear plant and grip chunks of highly radioactive melted fuel.\r\n",
      "The device is designed to slide down an extendable 11-meter (36-foot) long pipe and touch melted fuel inside the Unit 2 reactors primary containment vessel. The reactor was built by Toshiba and GE.\r\n",
      "An earlier probe carrying a camera captured images of pieces of melted fuel in the reactor last year, and robotic probes in the two other reactors have detected traces of damaged fuel, but the exact location, contents and other details remain largely unknown.\r\n",
      "Toshibas energy systems unit said experiments with the new probe planned in February are key to determining the proper equipment and technologies needed to remove the fuel debris, the most challenging part of the decommissioning process expected to take decades.\r\n",
      "The three reactors at the Fukushima plant suffered core meltdowns after a massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami damaged key cooling systems.\r\n",
      "In last years probe, a camera developed by Toshiba Energy Systems &amp; Solutions Corp. and the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning found large amounts of deposits in that area, including parts that resembled pebbles or gravel.\r\n",
      "The 30-centimeter (12-inch) long robot unveiled Monday will carry a radiation dosimeter, thermometer, LED lights, a camera and a pair of tongs as it slowly slides down from a pipe. The probe, attached by a cable on its back, is to dangle from the pipe and descend to the bottom of the reactor vessels pedestal, a structure directly below the core from which the melted fuel fell.\r\n",
      "Toshiba plans to use the new device to touch and grip the deposits with the tongs, which can hold a lump as wide as 8 centimeters (3 inches) weighing up to two kilograms (4.4 pounds), to investigate its hardness and other details, said Jun Suzuki, a Toshiba ESS group manager for the project.\r\n",
      "Until now we have only seen those deposits, and we need to know whether they will break off and can be picked up and taken out, Suzuki said. Touching the deposits is important so we can make plans to sample the deposits, which is a next key step.\r\n",
      "The probe will mainly examine the fuel debris physical condition rather than its radioactive components or other details which require actual sampling and safe storage.\r\n",
      "We are taking one step at a time, said Tsutomu Takeuchi, a Toshiba ESS senior manager for the Fukushima decommissioning project. First well find out if those deposits can be picked up. If the device is unable to lift anything, thats also a key finding, he said. In that case, they will need a cutting device to tear off a sample piece.\r\n",
      "TEPCO and government officials plan to determine methods for removing the melted fuel from each of the three damaged reactors later this year so they can begin the process in 2021.\r\n",

      "TOKYO The operator of the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant has begun removing fuel from a cooling pool at one of three reactors that melted down in the 2011 disaster, a milestone in the decades-long process to decommission the plant.\r\n",
      "Tokyo Electric Power Co. said Monday that workers started removing the first of 566 used and unused fuel units stored in the pool at Unit 3. The fuel units in the pool located high up in reactor buildings are intact despite the disaster, but the pools are not enclosed, so removing the units to safer ground is crucial to avoid disaster in case of another major quake.\r\n",
      "TEPCO says the removal at Unit 3 would take two years, followed by the two other reactors where about 1,000 fuel units remain in the storage pools.\r\n",
      "Removing fuel units from the cooling pools comes ahead of the real challenge of removing melted fuel from inside the reactors, but details of how that might be done are still largely unknown. Removing the fuel in the cooling pools was delayed more than four years by mishaps, high radiation and radioactive debris from an explosion that occurred at the time of the reactor meltdown, underscoring the difficulties that remain.\r\n",
      "Workers are remotely operating a crane built underneath a jelly roll-shaped roof cover to raise the fuel from a storage rack in the pool and place it into a protective cask. The whole process occurs underwater to prevent radiation leaks. Each cask will be filled with seven fuel units, then lifted from the pool and lowered to a truck that will transport the cask to a safer cooling pool elsewhere at the plant.\r\n",
      "The work is carried out remotely from a control room about 500 yards away because of still-high radiation levels inside the reactor building that houses the pool.\r\n",
      "About an hour after the work began Monday, the first fuel unit was safely stored inside the cask, TEPCO said.\r\n",
      "\"I believe everything is going well so far,\" plant chief Tomohiko Isogai told Japan's NHK television from Fukushima. \"We will watch the progress at the site as we put safety first. Our goal is not to rush the process but to carefully proceed with the decommissioning work.\"\r\n",
      "In 2014, TEPCO safely removed all 1,535 fuel units from the storage pool at a fourth reactor that was idle and had no fuel inside its core when the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami occurred.\r\n",
      "Robotic probes have photographed and detected traces of damaged nuclear fuel in the three reactors that had meltdowns, but the exact location and other details of the melted fuel are largely unknown. Removing fuel from the cooling pools will help free up space for the subsequent removal of the melted fuel, though details of how to gain access to it are yet to be decided.\r\n",
      "Experts say the melted fuel in the three reactors amounts to more than 800 tons.\r\n",
      "In February, a remote-controlled robot with tongs removed pebbles of nuclear debris from the Unit 2 reactor but was unable to remove larger chunks, indicating a robot would need to be developed that can break the chunks into smaller pieces. Toshiba Corp.'s energy systems unit, which developed the robot, said the findings were key to determining the proper equipment and technologies needed to remove the melted fuel, the most challenging part of the decommissioning expected to take decades.\r\n",
      "TEPCO and government officials plan to determine methods for removing the melted fuel from each of the three damaged reactors later this year so they can begin the process in 2021.\n",

      "Content:  496 NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - A top Myanmar investment official on Tuesday suggested alternatives such as scaling back or relocating a stalled Chinese-backed dam project that has strained ties between the neighbours. \r\n",
      "Myanmar angered China in 2011 when its former quasi-civilian government suspended the $3.6 billion Myitsone hydro-power dam in the country’s north amid environmental concerns. \r\n",
      "Asked about the dam at an investment conference, Thaung Tun, chairman of Myanmar’s investment commission, listed several problems, from an earthquake fault line running under the project site to a large catchment area affecting residents. \r\n",
      "“Catchment area would be twice the size of Singapore. This would mean that a lot of villages will have been displaced from their accessible land. That is the issue,” Thaung Tun told reporters at the conference in the capital Naypyitaw. \r\n",
      "Thaung Tun listed several alternatives, including scaling back the dam, moving it to a different location, or offering the operator an alternative project. He did not say if the government had a preferred option. \r\n",
      "Myanmar had to consider its relations with China, its largest trade partner, and “was working hard to find the solution,” he said. \r\n",
      "Spearheading these efforts is a commission launched by Aung San Suu Kyi’s government, which came to power in 2016, to review the dam. Myanmar also began informal talks with Beijing and dam operator Yunnan International Power Investment, a unit of State Power Investment Corp [CPWRI.UL]. \r\n",
      "China’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Beijing has previously said it would “maintain communication” with Myanmar over the project. \r\n",
      "Finding a solution is critical for Suu Kyi, who has benefited from Beijing’s support at the United Nations following a 2017 army crackdown that drove 730,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the former Burma. \r\n",
      "Myanmar also needs Beijing’s help in peace talks with several ethnic armed groups operating along northern and eastern borders with China. \r\n",
      "Thaung Tun said original plans for the dam were not “thought out” and failed to consider the impact on the community and the environment. \r\n",
      "The dam in the northern state of Kachin is very unpopular. Suu Kyi’s ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) lost a seat in Kachin by-elections last year and party officials have voiced concern about their popularity in ethnic minority areas ahead of the 2020 general election. \r\n",
      "China’s Yunnan province, the planned destination for about 90 percent of the dam’s electricity, now has a power surplus, Thaung Tun said. \r\n",
      "“There’s no need for this dam now,” he said. \r\n",
      "On Monday, Nobel laureate Suu Kyi opened the first government-led investment conference by calling on global investors to put their money in Myanmar, seeking to offset the negative impact of the Rohingya crisis and slow pace of economic reforms. \r\n",

      "Content:  497 ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) A record number of people want to run for president of Algeria in the countrys April election, amid growing uncertainty about whether incumbent Abdelaziz Bouteflika, infirm since a 2013 stroke, is fit for yet another term after two decades in charge of this gas-rich North African nation.\r\n",
      "In the two weeks since the electoral process was launched, 186 people have requested the documents needed to declare their candidacy. Thats more than double the number of potential candidates at this stage in the last presidential election, in 2014.\r\n",
      "Most will never get the signatures necessary to formally get on the April 18 ballot. But the range of candidates suggests wide frustration with the status quo.\r\n",
      "Bouteflika, 82, is all but certain to announce soon that he plans to seek a fifth five-year term. Yet his fitness for office was already a question in the 2014 election, coming a year after a stroke left him speaking and moving with difficulty and largely in a wheelchair.\r\n",
      "He has only been seen in public a few times a year throughout his entire fourth term yet many Algerians would likely vote for Bouteflika again, for fear of the instability that his departure could unleash.\r\n",
      "Algerias Western allies also worry about a political earthquake in Africas largest country by land mass, home to 42 million people and an al-Qaida affiliate that has targeted foreigners in the past.\r\n",
      "Among Bouteflikas top challengers are former Prime Minister Ali Benflis, the runner-up in 2014 and todays main opposition candidate; influential retired Gen. Ali Ghediri; and the leader of a moderate Islamist party, Abderazak Makri.\r\n",
      "The heads of several small political parties from across the spectrum are also hoping to run along with many Algerians who dont have the slightest links to politics.\r\n",
      "Would-be candidate Salah Kemmach wants to run because he was born the day that former President Houari Boumediene died in 1978.\r\n",
      "For me, its a sign of destiny he says in a video getting attention on social media. I decided to take my responsibility to continue (Boumedienes) project, abandoned by those who succeeded him.\r\n",
      "Another candidate, a former street cleaner from the western city of Oran, says he wants to be president to eat steak.\r\n",
      "While some dismiss the wannabe presidents as nothing more than carnival jesters, political science professor Mohamed Laggab of Algiers University says the huge number of potential candidates is a sign of degradation in Algerian politics.\r\n",
      "Political practices have fallen very low. When holders of dirty money buy parliament seats with billions, when people implicated in legal scandals find themselves in visible political posts, when people with no intellectual experience and no political conscience want to become president, minister, senator then you shouldnt be surprised to see today this type of candidate, he told The Associated Press.\r\n",
      "Corruption has long eaten away at public trust in Algeria, from its opaque energy sector to the highest levels of politics. Dirty money scandals surrounded the 2017 parliamentary election, with the son of the governing party leader suspected of taking bribes in exchange for spots on the partys candidate list. Other parties said they were approached by people offering to drum up signatures for potential candidates in exchange for cash.\r\n",
      "To get on the ballot, candidates must gather 60,000 signatures of citizens or 6,000 signatures of elected officials, spread out over 25 of Algerias 48 administrative departments.\r\n",
      "Bouteflika won the 2014 election with 81 percent of the vote despite not even appearing in his own campaign. He is appreciated for helping reconcile the country after a devastating civil war in the 1990s between Islamic insurgents and the military that left around 200,000 people dead.\r\n",
      "But the country and its people remain scarred by the years of violence. Algeria also still struggles with sporadic extremism and its struggling economy is heavily dependent on volatile world oil prices.\n",

      "Content:  498 BEIJING A massive blast at a chemical factory ripped through an industrial zone on Chinas eastern seaboard on Thursday, killing 47 people and injuring more than 600, local authorities said. \r\n",
      "The explosion around 3 p.m. on Thursday left a crater in the ground, flattened nearby structures and spewed toxic fumes over a vast region that abutted residential areas and schools in Yancheng, a city in Jiangsu Province about 180 miles north of Shanghai.\r\n",
      "About 4,000 workers and nearby residents have been evacuated, the Yancheng government said on its Weibo account. Ninety people remain in critical condition from the blast, which blew out windows and collapsed roofs in a neighborhood a mile away, according to eyewitness videos.\r\n",
      "The blast carried echoes of the massive chemical warehouse explosion in 2015 in the northern coastal city of Tianjin, which killed more than 160 people and sparked an accountability crisis for Chinas leaders. In a torrent of outrage following that explosion, Chinese citizens accused local and central leaders of failing to improve the countrys poor industrial safety record and covering up the extent of the devastation.\r\n",
      "Videos and photos circulating online on Friday showed thick gray smoke billowing over the Yancheng blast site and children crying with blood stains on their faces. Some reports and social media posts were quickly censored by authorities, prompting a fresh round of criticism about another possible coverup.\r\n",
      "The plant where the blast occurred is owned by Jiangsu Tianjiayi Chemical Co., a company with a long record of environmental violations over the past three years, according to Chinas Securities Daily newspaper. It mostly produces benzene and is located among a dozen factories operating in the industrial park.\r\n",
      "Police have already detained officials from Tianjiayi Chemical, the Yancheng government said.\r\n",
      "Local media reported that a kindergarten was situated less than a mile away from the facility. One 74-year old eyewitness told The Paper, a Shanghai-based outlet, that he heard two distinct explosions less than a second apart that were so forceful they shattered the windows and buckled the ceilings of the house he was in, one mile away from the blast site.\r\n",
      "The blast was so violent it was suspected of triggering a 2.2-magnitude tremor in a nearby county that was picked up by Chinas earthquake monitors.\r\n",
      "Authorities said the raging fire required 192 firetrucks and nearly 1,000 firefighters working more than 14 hours to put it out.\r\n",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is in Rome to sign an agreement bringing Italy into his Belt and Road investment plan, ordered officials to mount an all-out response to the accident while the Chinese cabinet set up an emergency investigation team. The state-run Xinhua News Agency warned local officials in a commentary that they were learning lessons paid for in blood because of a string of recent major safety lapses.\r\n",
      "Chinese officials have vowed for years to improve the countrys dismal safety record, but high-profile accidents have continued to make headlines. Explosions in Sichuan and Hebei Provinces last year killed 19 and 23 people, respectively.\r\n",
      "There were 51,000 industrial accidents in 2018, which killed over 34,000 people, according to official Chinese data.\r\n",

      "The University of South Carolina is launching a campaign to help students stay safe when using rideshares in light of the killing of a who got into a car she thought was her Uber.\r\n",
      "The body of Samantha Josephson, 21, was found Friday hours after she was reported missing after she failed to return home after a night out with friends.\r\n",
      "Surveillance video showed Josephson entering a car the morning she went missing, police said, and a suspect, Nathaniel D. Rowland, 25, is in custody facing charges of kidnapping and murder.\r\n",
      "Investigators said Josephson had ordered an Uber, and they believe she thought Rowland's car was her ride.\r\n",
      "Samantha Josephson, a University of South Carolina student who was reported missing after last being seen on March 29, 2019. The university on Saturday confirmed the death of the student.Columbia Police Department via AP\r\n",
      "After news of Josephson's death broke, University of South Carolina President Harris Pastides said the college would do everything it could to prevent another such death.\r\n",
      "The new campaign is called, \"What's My Name.\"\r\n",
      "\"We want every college student in America to take a pledge that says they will never get into a rideshare without first asking the driver, 'What's my name,' to make sure that they are getting in the right vehicle,\" Pastides said.\r\n",
      "Pastides said the university has received worried calls from parents asking how they can keep their children safe using ridesharing.\r\n",
      "The university offers shuttles and has a police presence, Pastides said, but he added that any problem of rideshare driver impersonators is more than just a local issue.\r\n",
      "\"This is really a national problem. We thought we had a safe city here and a safe campus, but this might happen again this weekend if a student gets into one of those vehicles and hasn't fully confirmed that it's the right vehicle,\" he said.\r\n",
      "Most rideshare services offer safety tools, such as describing the vehicle and license plate number of the service's driver, but Pastides said asking \"What's my name?\" is one more layer of protection.\r\n",
      "\"I think we can save lives. I think we owe it to the college population in the U.S. because this will happen again if we don't follow safety precautions,\" Pastides said.\r\n",
      "Josephson is far from the first person to enter a vehicle believing it was their rideshare.\r\n",
      "In Las Vegas, a woman jumped from a moving car after discovering she had entered the wrong vehicle. In Chicago, police warned that fake rideshare drivers scammed passengers out of hundreds of dollars after claiming there was a payment issue. In Tuscaloosa, Alabama, a fake Uber driver admitted to police that he had been photographing unconscious women in his car.\r\n",
      "In order to prevent similar incidents from happening, Uber has offered a range of suggestions on how to stay safe when using a rideshare.\r\n",
      "In addition to checking the license plate, the make and model of the car, and that the person in the photo matches the image on the app, Uber suggests travelers riding alone should sit in the back seat of the car in order to have an exit on either side. The company also suggests sharing trip details with a friend through a \"share status\" option on the app.\r\n",

      "Content:  503 CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand Three students from Cashmere High School were at the Al Noor Mosque for Friday prayers when an attacker burst in as part of a rampage that left 50 dead across the New Zealand city of Christchurch. When classes resume Monday, none will be there.\r\n",
      "Two of the students are presumed dead and the third is in the hospital with gunshot wounds.\r\n",
      "The father of Sayyad Milne, 14, told the New Zealand Herald that his son was last seen lying on the bloody floor of the mosque bleeding from his lower body.\r\n",
      "\"I've lost my little boy. He's just turned 14. I'll get it together again,\" he told the newspaper.\r\n",
      "\"I remember him as my baby who I nearly lost when he was born. Such a struggle he's had throughout all his life. He's been unfairly treated but he's risen above that and he's very brave. A brave little soldier. It's so hard ... to see him just gunned down by someone who didn't care about anyone or anything,\" Milne said. \"I know where he is. I know he's at peace.\"\r\n",
      "Current students weren't the only ones caught in Friday's mass shootings, the deadliest terrorist attacks in the country's modern history. A former Cashmere High School student is also believed to have been killed, as was the father of another student.\r\n",
      "Outside the school on Sunday, students came in a trickle to lean bouquets of flowers up against a construction barricade, evidence of the ongoing rebuilding from Christchurch's 2011 earthquake.\r\n",
      "Principal Mark Wilson said counselors and trauma specialists will be on hand when classes resume at the diverse school of more than 2,000.\r\n",
      "\"I'm very confident in our staff; I'm very confident in our school community. It's made up of awesome people,\" Wilson said. \"It's still going to be hard. There's going to be a lot of grief. There's going to be a lot of sadness. I think we've also got to be very patient with each other.\"\r\n",
      "Wilson declined to talk about the boys believed to have been killed, but confirmed three students were at the mosque on Friday and said one remained hospitalized with gunshot wounds to the leg.\r\n",
      "The principal noted that schools can often be a safe place for children coping with trauma. He is also encouraging students to take up their own acts of love to counteract the tragedy.\r\n",
      "\"It can be quite easy to get overwhelmed with all of the hate and the trauma of this situation and what's really important is that love will triumph in this situation,\" Wilson said. \"It's often in the small things that you can do in terms of visiting people, making a cup of tea for somebody, having a smile, giving some support and some love.\"\r\n",
      "Students Finn Barclay and Oki Tillia, both 17, spent the weekend doing baking and collecting toys to take to workers and victims of the attacks. They are also organizing a student vigil Monday afternoon outside one of the mosques that was attacked.\r\n",

      "Content:  506 TOKYO (Reuters) - A noted U.S.-born scholar of Japanese literature who received the country’s highest cultural award, Donald Keene, has died of heart failure in Tokyo, domestic media said on Sunday. He was 96. \r\n",
      "Keene was known for introducing Japan’s culture in the United States and around the world through his scholarship and translations of classical and modern Japanese literature. \r\n",
      "“We mourn the passing of Professor Keene,” the Donald Keene Center of Japanese Culture at New York’s Columbia University said on its website. \r\n",
      "Keene, who befriended giants of Japanese literature such as Yukio Mishima and Yasunari Kawabata, was awarded the Order of Culture in March 2008, the first non-Japanese to receive it, and became a Japanese citizen in 2012. \r\n",
      "He graduated from university in 1942 and studied Japanese under the auspices of the U.S. Navy before working in military intelligence during World War Two, interrogating prisoners and translating documents. \r\n",
      "Keene went on to a career as a scholar of Japanese literature and was credited with a key role in winning recognition for “The Tale of Genji”, an 11th-century masterpiece often called the world’s first novel, as world-class literature. \r\n",
      "After more than half a century teaching at Columbia University, Keene moved to Tokyo full-time and took Japanese citizenship following the devastating earthquake and nuclear disaster in northeast Japan in 2011. \r\n",

      "LOS ANGELES - Not many, if any, of the great music documentaries or concert films have ever screened in the exact location where they were shot: \"Woodstock\" did not show at Woodstock, and \"Wattstax\" did not premiere at the L.A. Coliseum, needless to say. But Sunday night, \"Amazing Grace\" had its official southern California premiere right where the recording of Aretha Franklin's live gospel album and belated movie accompaniment went down in 1972: the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in South Los Angeles.\r\n",
      "Although the word may not exactly fit with the African-American Christian tradition, the word \"mecca\" was used a lot Sunday, in connection with intentions to turn the church and its surrounding area into a site that will be recognized by the city of L.A. as a civic monument to Franklin.\r\n",
      "\"To all of you who are here as visitors, we want you to save your directions in Waze, because we want you to come back,\" said L.A. City Councilman Marqueece Harris-Dawson, addressing the crowd at a reception before the screening. \"We will nominate and successfully declare New Temple Missionary Baptist Church a historic landmark in the city of Los Angeles. And so we thank you for being here, and we thank you for coming back.\" Additionally, Harris-Dawson said,\" in memorial of this neighborhood's gift of culture to the world, as a beacon for the culture of former African slaves who made their way across the country to build this metropolis we call Los Angeles, on this past Friday we submitted a motion to the Los Angeles City Council and to the mayor to make 87th and Broadway Aretha Franklin Square.\"\r\n",
      "On top of all that, said L.A. County supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, \"We're going to put in an application to have the Southern California Community Choir [which accompanies Franklin on record and film] designated on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with their own star. ... We're gonna do the historical designation and then we're gonna do the walk of fame. She deserves that, doesn't she? Doesn't this choir deserve this? Doesn't gospel music deserve it?\"\r\n",
      "Many of the original choir members were on hand for the premiere, including choir director Alexander Hamilton and standout soloist Mary Hall, who helped organize the screening. They gave an impromptu gospel performance of their own just off the red carpet in the blazing L.A. sun before the screening, while inside, the contemporary version of the Southern California Choir ran through two spirited numbers before the screening. Because the screen that was set up to show the film blocked the area where the choir sat in the filming, the choir members mostly sat amid the audience, creating a surround-sound effect better than anything available via THX.\r\n",
      "Once the movie started, it wasn't always easy to distinguish between the whoops and audience sing-alongs on screen and what was happening with the 2019 crowd. It didn't hurt that the church building, formerly a neighborhood movie house, is virtually unchanged from how it was captured on screen in early 1972, except for the addition of eight earthquake-proofing pillars in the sanctuary and a changeover from the original theater seats to pews. When Lady Soul walks down the aisle on two occasions (one for each night of recording/filming), attendees turned around to imagine her there. A shot that the original director, Sydney Pollack, took through the projection room window prompted crowd members to turn around and see if that window was still there. It was, although, with a movie showing in the former Mayfair Theatre for most likely the first time since it was converted to a church in 1958, that projection room went unused and a digital projector was set up amid the rear pews.\r\n",
      "For producer Alan Elliott, who bought the uncompleted film reels from Warner Bros. and shepherded the project for more than a decade, and two producers who came on to the movie later, Sabrina Owens, Franklin's niece and estate executor, and Tirrell Whittley, it was a homecoming to a home they had only previously seen through hundreds or (in Elliott's case) thousands and thousands of hours of looking at the '72 footage.\r\n",
      "\"We could have gone to the ArcLight, easily,\" for the premiere, Whittley said. \"We could have even gone to (the theater in) Baldwin Hills tonight. But the decision, mostly made by this man here (Elliott), was, 'Nope, we're going to the church where Aretha recorded this movie.'\"\r\n",
      "\"There's a certain reverence about being here,\" Elliott said on the red carpet before the screening. \"James Cleveland says this in the movie: While they were here for an album and a movie that were being made, it was also a religious service. So to be able to come back for another religious service opportunity and show the movie I think is something pretty special. We're at the holiest of holies, right here at the epicenter of where it actually happened. This place endures, and the r-e-s-p-e-c-t that Johann Sebastian Back's church in St. Thomas has or Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart has with his church in Salzburg, this church should be treated that way.\"\r\n",
      "For many of a certain age and spiritual inclination in the African-American community, the album \"Amazing Grace\" -- said to be the biggest selling black gospel album of all time, and Franklin's highest seller to this day -- was so important, it was as important to them as \"Rumours,\" \"Frampton Comes Alive\" or even \"Thriller\" eventually were to anyone else. And that was decades before anyone ever realized there was an unseen film attached.\r\n",
      "\"This is the community I've represented for 30 years, and I've lived in Los Angeles for all of my life,\" said Ridley-Thomas on the red carpet, \"and it's hard to grow up in Los Angeles in particular, or anywhere for that matter, and not have this be a familiar soundtrack, for many people, myself included.\"\r\n",
      "Ridley-Thomas grew more solemn when Variety asked about the death a few short miles away of hip-hop's Nipsey Hussle, after a shooting less than two hours before that most of the visiting celebrants were not yet aware of. \"I'm doing my best\" to keep apprised of the situation, he said. \"We send our condolences to any of those who came to know him and respect him and were a part of the trajectory of his life. There was an increasingly more positive perspective on the millennial generation that we saw through him.\"\r\n",
      "Later, at the pre-reception, there were gasps and even a shriek or two when Hussle's death was announced.\r\n",
      "\"If you all will indulge me for a second, my heart's very heavy this afternoon,\" Councilman Harris-Dawson told the crowd. \"We celebrate the life of Aretha Franklin. We recall losing Sam Cooke nearby. [Cooke was shot to death at a motel 12 blocks away.] We recall tomorrow is the anniversary of losing Marvin Gaye. And very, very sadly, just this afternoon, this neighborhood's latest Grammy nominee lost his life to gun violence. The one and only Nipsey Hussle passed away at 33 years old about 45 minutes ago. So it's a good time for some good singing,\" he said, before getting caught up in emotion, as choir member Hall patted his back.\r\n",
      "Another councilman, Herb Wesson, further commemorated the fresh tragedy.\r\n",
      "\"It wouldn't be right if we were in a house of worship and we didn't show our ecumenical, interfaith respect,\" said Wesson. \"The mark of civilization is how we treat the dead. And so just a moment of silence seems to me to be in order... to focus on the horrific challenge, the epidemic of gun violence, that continues to define too much of the space that we occupy, and I mean that broadly speaking. So let's bow our heads in a moment of silence in memory of Nipsey Hussle and all the others who are stricken with this scourge of gun violence.\"\r\n",
      "Hall, who very much deserves costar status on the movie. alluded to the many forms of pain that inform the joyful noise heard in both its 1972 and 2019 forms inside the sanctuary. \"Forty-six years ago,\" she said, \"when Aretha said, 'I've come through many dangers, toils and snares,' I had not come through any. I was 22 years old, not knowing nothing, a young lady starstruck -- first singing with the King of Gospel (James Cleveland), and then to be with Aretha Franklin at 22 was an awesome experience. But 46 years later, I can truly say that through many dangerous toils and snares, nothing but a God and his amazing grace has gotten us to this point.\" She then thanked her current pastor for giving her the weekend off to organize the screening and performance and assured him she'd be back at her post next Sunday.\r\n",
      "It was definitely not a \"Hollywood\" audience for the premiere, although Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich and a number of agents and managers made the trip to South L.A. The difference was obvious during some of the movie's cameo appearances: The first sight of legendary director Pollack on screen drew no murmurs, the way it has in Beverly Hills screenings, but the first sight of gospel legend Cleveland drew a church-rattling roar. Of course, when Mick Jagger pops up in a couple of audience shots, rocking out to the gospel, that's good for an appreciative laugh in any setting.\r\n",
      "The producers had other reasons to celebrate. \"Amazing Grace\" won a best documentary award at the NAACPs Image Awards the night before, besting high-profile films about Quincy Jones and Whitney Houston, among others. Tuesday night, the premiere rollout continues in New York, as a screening takes place in the Time building in Manhattan to be cohosted by music industry titan Clive Davis, Franklin's latter-period benefactor, and Rev. Al Sharpton.\r\n",
      "The Neon-distributed film opens in limited release in L.A. and New York Friday and expands to about 1,000 screens on Easter weekend.\n",

      "Title:  510 20 years ago, a thunderous explosion shook the Lehigh Valley\n",
      "Content:  510 ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) Two decades later, it's the thunderous boom the unmistakable sound of something disastrous that many in the Lehigh Valley remember about that night.\r\n",
      "But for Amy Heller, who was inside Concept Sciences Inc. on Feb. 19, 1999 a milestone night crucial to the chemical company's fortunes the quiet stands out.\r\n",
      "Crossing the production floor of the big plant that Friday, Heller walked past a colleague, Anthony Mondello, who was reading a book of Edgar Allan Poe's poetry. She chatted with Paul Mondello, Anthony's son, about his upcoming wedding, and he drew a picture of a guitar he wanted to make. She thanked Ruben Soto for the frozen lasagna he had given her because she had brought him dinner earlier in the week.\r\n",
      "The plant's machinery was humming, turning a powdered ammonia derivative called hydroxylamine into what the Hanover Township, Lehigh County, company hoped would be a lucrative final product, a liquid used for cleaning production residue from computer chips.\r\n",
      "Only two other companies in the world made the solution one in Germany, the other in Japan so the market was ripe for Concept Sciences, founded by chemist and entrepreneur Irl \"Chip\" Ward Jr.\r\n",
      "The task that night was to make the company's first large-scale, commercial batch of the product. Recounting events in a written statement she gets too emotional to talk about it Heller said no one seemed worried, despite a mechanical glitch that prompted a call to the Northampton home of plant manager Paul Wanamaker. A few minutes after 8 p.m., he arrived to look things over.\r\n",
      "The 20,000-square-foot plant was housed in one of those nondescript industrial parks that line Route 22 between Bethlehem and Allentown. Besides Heller, the workers on hand included the Mondellos, Anthony, 55, of Pen Argyl, and Paul, 25, of Palmer Township; Wanamaker, 42; Soto, 52, of Bethlehem; and Deliang \"Dave\" Ding, 40, a lab technician from Wescosville.\r\n",
      "Everything seemed fine. Until it wasn't.\r\n",
      "In an office next door to Concept Sciences was 48-year-old Terry Bowers, who lived in Hanover Township, Lehigh County, not far from the industrial park. He managed Sugarloaf Mid-Atlantic, a manufacturer of toy vending machines.\r\n",
      "The distillation process at Concept Sciences involved mixing several hundred pounds of hydroxylamine described in chemical industry literature as \"thermally unstable\" and capable of spontaneously igniting in the air or on contact with copper or other metals with potassium sulfate.\r\n",
      "Earlier in the week, the process had been shut down because of a water leak. Now, another problem had cropped up crystals had formed in the distillation still, indicating the mix had grown unstable. That's what prompted the call to Wanamaker.\r\n",
      "By the time he arrived, Heller, of Orefield, was in her office cubicle, away from the production machinery. Ding was in the break room, eating a pretzel.\r\n",
      "Heller, 26 at the time, had just finished graduate work in analytical chemistry. She had been hired six months earlier to analyze samples from the production process and had no part in the mechanical end of things.\r\n",
      "\"Everything seemed fine,\" she wrote. \"Until it wasn't.\"\r\n",
      "At 8:14 p.m., the process tank exploded with a deafening roar.\r\n",
      "And for Heller, \"everything turned brown.\"\r\n",
      "'A very chaotic night'\r\n",
      "The blast was equivalent to roughly 800 pounds of TNT. People heard it as far away as the Poconos and the smoke was visible for seven miles.\r\n",
      "At Lehigh University, five miles south, the explosion registered on a seismograph as a 0.7 magnitude earthquake. The readings showed the ground at the blast site moved up and down and side to side.\r\n",
      "\"I remember screaming but not hearing myself,\" Heller wrote. \"The next thing I remember is hearing a man yelling, but I was too terrified to make a sound or move.\"\r\n",
      "The concussion shattered windows at nearby homes. Sections of the frame that held the distillation equipment were thrown 1,000 feet. A cloud drifted downwind of the plant and rained a whitish chemical residue over Allentown it was later deemed to be nonhazardous and the power went out for more than 1,800 PPL Electric Utilities customers in the area.\r\n",
      "The blast gouged a hole 6 feet wide, 26 feet long and 16 inches deep in the concrete floor below the tank. Eleven other buildings in the industrial park were damaged, including a day care center, as were a number of cars crushed by a collapsed wall.\r\n",
      "The human toll was terrible. The Mondellos, Wanamaker and Soto died. Heller and Ding were buried in rubble.\r\n",
      "Bowers, next door at Sugarloaf Mid-Atlantic, was shielded by a concrete block wall, but it wasn't enough to protect him. He died when a piece of metal struck his head.\r\n",
      "More than 400 firefighters and other emergency personnel from three counties scores of fire trucks, ambulances and police poured into the site and beheld a landscape of smoldering ruin.\r\n",
      "\"It was a very chaotic night,\" said Garren Knoll, a firefighter then in his mid-20s who is now chief of the Han-Le-Co Fire Company. \"It was a very long day and night. I think I was there for about 20 hours.\"\r\n",
      "Robin Yoder, Han-Le-Co fire chief at the time, arrived minutes after the blast he had been out driving when he heard emergency calls on the scanner and knew immediately he was dealing with something far more powerful than a natural gas mishap.\r\n",
      "\"I had the state police with me right off the bat and their question was, 'What do you want us to do?' I knew I had a day care center down at the end, so I told them to go down and check to make sure it was empty.\"\r\n",
      "As more first responders arrived, Yoder directed them to look for survivors. They came upon Heller, who had managed to thrust a hand up through the rubble.\r\n",
      "\"Eventually someone found me, pulled me out and took me to a decontamination tent,\" Heller recalled. \"I was then taken to St. Luke's (Hospital). I distinctly remember asking someone in the ambulance for a cellphone so I could call my parents. I will never forget hearing my dad's voice on the other end of the line.\"\r\n",
      "At the time, rescuers said Heller likely survived because a large piece of metal had shielded her from a cascade of concrete blocks.\r\n",
      "Ding suffered two broken ribs and a broken arm. In an interview from his hospital bed two days after the disaster, he said he had slipped in and out of consciousness, unable to move from the weight of the debris, until a team of Catasauqua firefighters noticed a pair of bare feet sticking out. Ding literally had been blown out of his shoes.\r\n",
      "Yoder, even then a seasoned firefighter, said he encountered Irl Ward in the chaos.\r\n",
      "\"He came up to me and said, 'This is a gas explosion.' I looked him straight in the face and said, 'No, it isn't. What are you doing in there that could cause this kind of explosion?'\r\n",
      "\"He said they weren't doing anything that could have.\"\r\n",
      "Charges dismissed\r\n",
      "In all, 14 people were injured, including first responders and workers at a nearby package delivery facility. Heller suffered a ruptured eardrum and a lot of bruises, plus emotional trauma that crops up at times even today.\r\n",
      "\"Loud, unexpected sounds sometimes alarm me more than they should,\" she wrote.\r\n",
      "Three days after the blast, Ward held a tearful news conference and vowed to find out what happened.\r\n",
      "\"I will not rest until I know what went wrong,\" he said.\r\n",
      "Federal investigators, however, determined that whatever went wrong could have been prevented had Ward heeded warnings from a year earlier, when a company told him the distillation process Concept Sciences was using could be dangerous.\r\n",
      "That information emerged in November 2000 when a federal grand jury in Philadelphia indicted Ward on 12 criminal counts under workplace safety laws.\r\n",
      "The indictment said Ashland Chemical, the Ohio company that had agreed to buy the free base from Concept Sciences, sent Ward a memo warning that his method of distilling hydroxylamine was a \"significant safety issue\" and \"probably will not work.\"\r\n",
      "On the memo, the indictment said, Ward scrawled \"Baloney!\"\r\n",
      "In 2002, the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board released a case study saying the explosion was \"most likely\" due to high concentration and temperature in the distilling process. The more concentrated hydroxylamine becomes, the more unstable.\r\n",
      "That is why the Japanese company, Nissin Chemicals, was distilling it to only 50 percent. An hour before the explosion at Concept Sciences, the concentration had reached 86 percent, according to the indictment, and crystals had formed in the still, spelling trouble. Heat, federal investigators concluded, likely triggered the blast.\r\n",
      "Overheating contributed to a similar explosion 16 months later that destroyed Nissin's plant, killing four people and injuring 28. That left one company, German chemical giant BASF, as the world's only supplier of the lucrative product.\r\n",
      "Ward faced a maximum sentence of two years in prison and a $3 million fine. But the charges, all misdemeanors, were dismissed less than a year later, when a federal judge ruled it was unclear whether Concept Science's production process was covered under certain manufacturing regulations.\r\n",
      "Jessica Mondello, who lost her father and brother in the blast, believes the judge's ruling was wrong.\r\n",
      "\"It's unfair it happened and it never should have happened,\" she said in a recent interview.\r\n",
      "When the judge dismissed the case on Sept. 10, 2001, Mondello focused her anger on Ward, saying \"I think it's just disgusting that he's getting away with it. You feel like there's no justice.\"\r\n",
      "Ward, who has never commented, declined several recent requests to be interviewed.\r\n",
      "Fay Wanamaker of Northampton, widow of Paul Wanamaker, was measured in her response when contacted recently.\r\n",
      "\"All I know is, I Iived through it and I survived, and that's all I keep thinking about,\" she said. \"I really don't have anything more to say.\"\r\n",
      "Lessons learned\r\n",
      "In 2005, the families of four of the victims settled lawsuits against the company's primary financial backers. The confidential agreements ended the major litigation stemming from the blast. Workers compensation laws prevented employees' families from suing Concept Sciences or Ward, so they instead sued Ashland Chemical and several related companies, including equipment providers.\r\n",
      "Concept Sciences settled with federal and state agencies that had imposed fines and cleanup costs, paying $300,000 to the state Department of Environmental Protection for cleanup after the blast less than half of what the agency sought and $250,000 in fines to the federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration for violating workplace safety rules.\r\n",
      "In 2004, Ward started a new company, PPT Research Inc., which produces non-volatile liquid abrasives and coolants for machining operations. The company is on Business Park Lane in east Allentown just south of Route 22 and within two miles of the Roble Road facility that housed Concept Sciences.\r\n",
      "Seth Weber, a former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted the case against Ward, said he trusts Ward has made appropriate changes to ensure his workers' safety and to protect the environment.\r\n",
      "\"Hopefully, it was a lesson that Mr. Ward learned,\" Weber said.\r\n",
      "John Kalynych, coordinator of Lehigh County's special operations team, which deals with everything from hazardous spills to building collapses, remembers the night vividly. He was one of four firefighters who rescued Heller from the wreckage.\r\n",
      "He said it would be unrealistic to say emergency responders are completely equipped to deal with every catastrophic situation. But Lehigh County has committed more resources and greatly improved its emergency preparedness, he said, noting the county added a rescue unit to its haz-mat department about 10 years ago.\r\n",
      "\"The response capabilities have been enhanced considerably since Concept Sciences,\" he said. \"We are in a much better place to respond to something of that magnitude today.\"\r\n",
      "The 2002 case study by the chemical safety investigation board said another factor contributing to the scale of the disaster was where Concept Sciences, a company dealing in volatile chemicals, was allowed to operate in a mixed-use industrial park that included other businesses.\r\n",
      "Hanover Township's zoning laws permitted the use at the time. Concept Sciences opened there because its first choice, neighboring Hanover Township, Northampton County, prohibited chemical manufacturing.\r\n",
      "Yoder, the former fire chief, said such uses are no longer allowed under that zoning. The township also now inspects every building within its borders every five years.\r\n",
      "Kerry Wrobel, president of Lehigh Valley Industrial Park Inc., said in addition to permits required by municipalities for companies that want to locate in one of LVIP's seven parks, the LVIP board requires bulk chemical manufacturers to obtain a special exception.\r\n",
      "\"In my nearly 18 years, we have not seen uses that require any special exceptions,\" Wrobel said.\r\n",
      "Nobody should have to worry about saying goodbye to their loved ones as they go to work, only to have them not come home that night.\r\n",
      "Amy Heller, who survived the blast\r\n",
      "Twenty years later, 749 Roble Road is home to another nondescript industrial building. No memorial marks the episode. But Knoll, the fire chief, said someone made a plaque that hangs in the Han-Le-Co firehouse. It includes photos of the wreckage and a melted piece of a fire extinguisher found in the blast.\r\n",
      "Heller said her memories of the events are difficult, \"but the physical and emotional trauma I suffered pales in comparison to what the Mondello, Wanamaker and Soto families have gone through, as well as the family of the gentleman (Bowers) who worked next door.\r\n",
      "\"Nobody should have to worry about saying goodbye to their loved ones as they go to work, only to have them not come home that night.\"\r\n",

      "Content:  515 TEHRAN, Iran (AP) Fissures appear along roads while massive holes open up in the countryside, their gaping maws a visible sign from the air of something Iranian authorities now openly acknowledge: the area around Tehran is literally sinking.\r\n",
      "Stressed by a 30-year drought and hollowed by excessive water pumping, the parched landscape around Irans capital has begun to sink dramatically. Seen by satellite and on foot around the city, officials warn that what they call land subsidence poses a grave danger to a country where protests over water scarcity already have seen violence.\r\n",
      "Land subsidence is a destructive phenomenon, said Siavash Arabi, a measurement expert at Irans cartography department. Its impact may not be immediately felt like an earthquake, but as you can see, it can gradually cause destructive changes over time.\r\n",
      "He said he can identify destruction of farmland, the cracks of the earths surface, damage to civilian areas in cities, wastewater lines, cracks in roads and damages to water and natural gas pipes.\r\n",
      "Tehran, which sits 1,200 meters (3,900 feet) above sea level against the Alborz Mountains on a plateau, has rapidly grown over the last 100 years to a sprawling city of 13 million people in its metropolitan area.\r\n",
      "All those people have put incredible pressure on water resources on a semi-arid plateau in a country that saw only 171 millimeters (6.7 inches) of rain last year. Over-reliance on ground aquifers has seen increasingly salty water pumped from below ground.\r\n",
      "Surface soil contains water and air. When you pump water from under the ground surface, you cause some empty space to be formed in the soil, Arabi told The Associated Press. Gradually, the pressure from above causes the soil particles to stick together and this leads to sinking of the ground and formation of cracks.\r\n",
      "Rain and snow to recharge the underground aquifers have been in short supply. Over the past decade, Iran has seen the most prolonged and severe drought in more than 30 years, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. An estimated 97 percent of the country has faced some level of drought, Irans Meteorological Organization says.\r\n",
      "That has caused the sinkholes and fissures now seen around Tehran.\r\n",
      "Iranian authorities say they have measured up to 22 centimeters (8.6 inches) of annual subsidence near the capital, while the normal range would be only as high as 3 centimeters (1.1 inches) per year.\r\n",
      "Even higher numbers have been measured in other parts of the country. Some sinkholes formed in western Iran are as deep as 60 meters (196 feet).\r\n",
      "Those figures are close to those found in a study by scientists at the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam previously discussed by the journal Nature and accepted by the journal Remote Sensing of Environment. Using satellite images between 2003 and 2017, the scientists estimate the western Tehran plain is sinking by 25 centimeters (9.8 inches) a year.\r\n",
      "Either way, the numbers are alarming to experts.\r\n",
      "In European countries, even 4 millimeters (0.15 inches) of yearly subsidence is considered a crisis, Iranian environmental activist Mohammad Darvish said.\r\n",
      "The sinking can be seen in Tehrans southern Yaftabad neighborhood, which sits close to farmland and water wells on the edge of the city. Cracks run down walls and below windows, and waterpipes have ruptured. Residents fear poorly built buildings may collapse.\r\n",
      "The sinking also threatens vital infrastructure, like Tehrans Imam Khomeini International Airport. German scientists estimate that land under the airport is sinking by 5 centimeters (1.9 inches) a year.\r\n",
      "Tehrans oil refinery, a key highway, automobile manufacturing plants and railroads also all sit on sinking ground, said Ali Beitollahi, a Ministry of Roads and Transportation official. Some 2 million people live in the area, he said.\r\n",
      "Masoud Shafiee, head of Irans cartography department, also acknowledged the danger.\r\n",
      "Rates (for subsidence) are very high and in many instances its happening in densely populated areas, Shafiee told the AP. Its happening near sensitive infrastructures like airports, which we consider a top priority.\r\n",
      "Geopolitics play a role in Irans water crisis. Since the countrys 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has sought to become self-sufficient across industries to thwart international sanctions. That has included agriculture and food production.\r\n",
      "The problem, however, comes in inefficient water use on farms, which represents over 90 percent of the countrys water usage, experts say.\r\n",
      "Already, the drought and water crisis has fed into the sporadic unrest Iran has faced over the last year. In July, protests around Khorramshahr, some 650 kilometers (400 miles) southwest of Tehran, saw violence as residents of the predominantly Arab city near the border with Iraq complained of salty, muddy water coming out of their taps amid the yearslong drought.\r\n",
      "The unrest there only compounds the wider unease felt across Iran as it faces an economic crisis sparked by President Donald Trumps decision to withdraw America from Tehrans nuclear deal with world powers.\r\n",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who long has opposed Irans theocratic government, even released an online video in June offering his countrys water technology in a jab at Irans leaders.\r\n",
      "The Iranian regime shouts: Death to Israel, Netanyahu said. In response, Israel shouts: Life to the Iranian people.\r\n",
      "Iranian officials shrugged off the offer. But solutions to the water crisis will be difficult to find.\r\n",
      "The crisis stems from decades of sanctions and compounding political mismanagement that is likely to make it very difficult to alleviate the emerging crisis before it wreaks lasting damage upon the country, wrote Gabriel Collins, a fellow at Rice Universitys Baker Institute.\r\n",
      "Iranian authorities have begun to crack down on illegal water wells. They also are exploring using desalinization plants along the Persian Gulf as well, though they require tremendous energy. Farming practices also need to change as well, experts say.\r\n",
      "We need to shift our development model so that it relies less on water and soil, Darvish, the activist, said. If we dont act quickly to stop the subsidence, it can spread to other areas.\n",

      "Content:  516 ALGIERS, Algeria In a story Feb. 10 about Algerias presidential election, The Associated Press reported erroneously that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika is 82. He is 81.\r\n",
      "A corrected version of the story is below:\r\n",
      "As Algerian leader ails, would-be challengers eye election\r\n",
      "A record number of people want to run for president of Algeria, amid uncertainty about whether stroke-hobbled President Abdelaziz Bouteflika is fit for yet another term\r\n",
      "By AOMAR OUALI\r\n",
      "Associated Press\r\n",
      "ALGIERS, Algeria A record number of people want to run for president of Algeria in the countrys April election, amid growing uncertainty about whether incumbent Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who said Sunday he plans to seek a fifth term despite being infirm since a 2013 stroke, is fit enough after two decades in charge of this gas-rich North African nation.\r\n",
      "In the two weeks since the electoral process was launched, 186 people have requested the documents needed to declare their candidacy. Thats more than double the number of potential candidates at this stage in the last presidential election, in 2014.\r\n",
      "Most will never get the signatures necessary to formally get on the April 18 ballot. But the range of candidates suggests wide frustration with the status quo.\r\n",
      "Bouteflika, 81, announced via Algerias official APS news agency Sunday that he plans to seek a further five-year term. Yet his fitness for office was already a question in the 2014 election, coming a year after a stroke left him speaking and moving with difficulty and largely confined to a wheelchair.\r\n",
      "He has only been seen in public a few times a year throughout his entire fourth term yet many Algerians would likely vote for Bouteflika again, for fear of the instability that his departure could unleash.\r\n",
      "Algerias Western allies also worry about a political earthquake in Africas largest country by land mass, home to 42 million people and an al-Qaida affiliate that has targeted foreigners in the past.\r\n",
      "Among Bouteflikas top challengers are former Prime Minister Ali Benflis, the runner-up in 2014 and todays main opposition candidate; influential retired Gen. Ali Ghediri; and the leader of a moderate Islamist party, Abderazak Makri.\r\n",
      "The heads of several small political parties from across the spectrum are also hoping to run along with many Algerians who dont have the slightest links to politics.\r\n",
      "Would-be candidate Salah Kemmach wants to run because he was born the day that former President Houari Boumediene died in 1978.\r\n",
      "For me, its a sign of destiny he says in a video getting attention on social media. I decided to take my responsibility to continue (Boumedienes) project, abandoned by those who succeeded him.\r\n",
      "Another candidate, a former street cleaner from the western city of Oran, says he wants to be president to eat steak.\r\n",
      "While some dismiss the wannabe presidents as nothing more than carnival jesters, political science professor Mohamed Laggab of Algiers University says the huge number of potential candidates is a sign of degradation in Algerian politics.\r\n",
      "Political practices have fallen very low. When holders of dirty money buy parliament seats with billions, when people implicated in legal scandals find themselves in visible political posts, when people with no intellectual experience and no political conscience want to become president, minister, senator then you shouldnt be surprised to see today this type of candidate, he told The Associated Press.\r\n",
      "Corruption has long eaten away at public trust in Algeria, from its opaque energy sector to the highest levels of politics. Dirty money scandals surrounded the 2017 parliamentary election, with the son of the governing party leader suspected of taking bribes in exchange for spots on the partys candidate list. Other parties said they were approached by people offering to drum up signatures for potential candidates in exchange for cash.\r\n",
      "To get on the ballot, candidates must gather 60,000 signatures of citizens or 6,000 signatures of elected officials, spread out over 25 of Algerias 48 administrative departments.\r\n",
      "Bouteflika won the 2014 election with 81 percent of the vote despite not even appearing in his own campaign. He is appreciated for helping reconcile the country after a devastating civil war in the 1990s between Islamic insurgents and the military that left around 200,000 people dead.\r\n",

      "By Kerry Sanders, Ezra Kaplan and Daniella Silva\r\n",
      "DERBY LINE, Vermont More than 960 people crossed into the U.S. illegally from the northern border with Canada last year, according to data released from Customs and Border Protection.\r\n",
      "While that number is a tiny fraction compared to the migration across the border with Mexico, it represented a 91 percent increase from the prior fiscal year, the data showed.\r\n",
      "The Trump administrations rhetoric on border security has largely homed in on the southern border, which has seen an influx of thousands of families with children from Central America seeking asylum in the United States.\r\n",
      "But officials have also seen an increase of illegal crossings on the northern border in the last fiscal year, according to the data. In fiscal year 2017, immigration agents apprehended 504 people crossing illegally from Canada, compared to 963 in fiscal year 2018, the border patrol data showed.\r\n",
      "For more on this story, watch NBC's \"Nightly News\" tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET\r\n",
      "A large percentage of that spike came from the Swanton border patrol sector along the border of New Hampshire, Vermont and New York where agents apprehended 548 people in 2018, up from 165 in all of 2017.\r\n",
      "Preliminary data from October to January shows 465 apprehensions from Canada, with 294 in the Swanton sector.\r\n",
      "Border Patrol Agent Richard Ross, who runs the border patrol station in Newport, Vermont, part of the Swanton sector, told NBC News he thought the apprehensions were \"definitely trending up.\" He added that the type of apprehensions agents were seeing were \"very organized,\" sometimes using smuggling organizations.\r\n",
      "Ross said he believed there may be a perception that traveling from Canada was \"safer\" and the increase could be attributed to recent immigration changes in Canada that allow those from some countries, such as Mexico and Romania, to enter without a visa.\r\n",
      "He said some immigrants looking to get into the U.S. illegally could pay a few hundred dollars for a flight to Canada, pay a small electronic travel authorization fee and make their way into the United States.\r\n",
      "Some smuggling agencies were \"exploiting the fact that there's an easier way to make it legally into Canada and then that provides some clientele to then be smuggled into the U.S.,\" he said.\r\n",
      "Ross said he had encountered instances of immigrants lured to Canada with the promise of employment. Once they arrive and there are no jobs, they become \"ready-made clientele\" for smugglers who charge them thousands more dollars.\r\n",
      "\"I'd like people to understand that this is not an easy area to cross. It's not safe. It can be very dangerous, especially under the conditions we're in right now, and it's equally as difficult to cross here as it is the southern border,\" Ross said.\r\n",
      "Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada did not immediately respond to request for comment, but a spokesperson told The Associated Press in July that the visa changes have had a minimal impact on the border.\r\n",
      "Erique Gasse, a spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Montreal, told NBC News he could not comment on what was happening on the U.S.-side when asked for a response on the increase in the latest apprehensions.\r\n",
      "This undated surveillance photo provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection shows people illegally crossing the United States border from Canada near Derby Line, Vermont. U.S. Customs and Border Protection via AP\r\n",
      "\"As for us, I am not aware theres a trend for that,\" he added. \"We do patrol along the border, if we see somebody crossing the border illegally from Canada to U.S.A., were going to talk to our colleagues in [U.S. Border Patrol], but for the rest, whats happening in the U.S.A., we dont have any control of that, so unfortunately I cannot say more than that.\"\r\n",
      "The RCMP has previously told CBC News it cannot stop Mexican citizens from walking out of Canada because it was not illegal for them to come to Canada in the first place.\r\n",
      "\"The smuggling is the offence or helping cross,\" RCMP Sgt. Camille Habel told CBC News in July. \"That is what we investigate.\"\r\n",
      "\"Recently we've seen cases where there would be one lone individual that was helping a group of individuals wanting to cross,\" she added.\r\n",

      "Title:  518 In an Indonesian city still struggling from last year's disasters, upcoming elections are a chance to protest\n",
      "Content:  518 JAKARTA, Indonesia Last fall, Haeruddin found his wife and 10-year-old son dead under the rubble of their home. \r\n",
      "It was one of roughly 100,000 buildings destroyed when a 7.4 magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami devastated Palu and other nearby cities on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi an area that has typically been a stronghold for Indonesias president, Joko Widodo.\r\n",
      "But when Indonesians go to the polls in legislative and presidential elections Wednesday, 40-year-old Haeruddin will not be among them.\r\n",
      "Im golput, he told The Washington Post, referring to the golput, or white, movement, named for the white part of a ballot paper rather than a candidates party logo.\r\n",
      "I would not be voting if the government doesnt pay attention to the people here, added Haeruddin, who uses one name, as do many Indonesians. All my neighbors will be golput, too.\r\n",
      "His decision reflects a growing trend across Indonesia as many potential voters say they will vote for no one for president. The idea is to send a message of dissatisfaction to Widodo, who is seeking a second term, and his competitor for a second time, Prabowo Subianto, a former military commander.\r\n",
      "Its unclear whether the blank-vote drive will have any major sway over the election results. Most opinion polls give Widodo a comfortable lead.\r\n",
      "[Indonesian tsunami struck as ultimate no-notice event]\r\n",
      "But there is little doubt that in places such as Palu, the anger is directed mostly at Widodo and his administration for the uneven response to last years twin disasters. Elsewhere in Indonesia, others who proclaim themselves golput are self-identified progressives dissatisfied with the president.\r\n",
      "But they also appear reluctant to back Prabowo, who allegedly committed human rights abuses in the past. Prabowo was accused of kidnapping dissidents during the New Order era under authoritarian president Suharto more than two decades ago.\r\n",
      "Widodo also has faced some criticism from secular-minded Indonesians for his choice of running mate, Maruf Amin, known for his belligerent stance on minority rights.\r\n",
      "Under Widodos watch, Indonesias handling of the Palu twin disasters was roundly criticized, as were its outdated warning systems that failed to predict the incoming tsunami. The government also limited foreign help afterward, opting to handle the response largely by itself as the death toll in Palu and surrounding areas reached about 4,000.\r\n",
      "Six months later, the recovery has stalled.\r\n",
      "Yusrin Banna, who led protests in Palu and neighboring cities last month, said many people are restless because aid promises never materialized.\r\n",
      "Weve met with victims. We went to shelters and temporary residences. In the end, after hearing their grievances, [we learned that] theyre growing nonchalant about politics. Theyre too busy minding themselves, he said.\r\n",
      "Damage in Palu, Indonesian authorities said, cost more than $1.6 billion. Some of the aid comes in different plans and installments all of which are at times hampered by discord between the central and local governments.\r\n",
      "Indonesias vice president, Jusuf Kalla, was angry, according to news reports, that pledges for daily relief allowances the equivalent of 70 cents for each family member have been caught up in red tape.\r\n",
      "[Indonesias disaster teams went it alone. That made them national heroes.]\r\n",
      "Haeruddin, too, said he has yet to receive the allowances and the promised rebuilding fund of about $3,500. He and his 4-year-old son recently moved in with his parents because their temporary residence was too hot and couldnt withstand rain.\r\n",
      "About 600 of the 1,200 temporary shelters initially planned have been built, according to Arie Setiadi Moerwanto, who leads the governments program to rebuild housing in Sulawesi.\r\n",
      "Opinions of elections among survivors of Indonesias natural disasters are varied, said Titi Anggraini, director of the monitoring group Association for Elections and Democracy, which has monitored Indonesian elections since 1999.\r\n",
      "Some of them got in contact with aid groups, so they became more humanitarian with their outlook, she said, referring to her findings in Banda Aceh province, which was struck by a tsunami in 2004 that killed more than 150,000 people in Indonesia and tens of thousands more across the Indian Ocean region. They may also tend to care for their well-beings, rather than politics.\r\n",
      "Golput rejectionists are not new. The movement goes back to the 1970s, when activists protested that Suharto regime elections were mere formalities.\r\n",
      "Indonesia held its first direct presidential election in 2004, six years after the toppling of Suhartos regime. Widodo won in Central Sulawesi by almost 10 points against Prabowo.\r\n",
      "Despite leading the protests last month, Yusrin said he will be voting but noted that many others will probably not.\r\n",
      "I ask people to exercise their political rights, he said. But of course, we cant force them.\r\n",

      "Title:  519 Updating software, shaping history: New imperial era name looms large in Japan\n",
      "Content:  519 TOKYO (Reuters) - In Japan, every emperor’s era has its own name - appearing in places such as coins, official paperwork and newspapers - and with abdication coming at the end of April, speculation is swirling about what the new “gengo” will be. \r\n",
      "Although the Western calendar has become more widespread in Japan, many people here count years in terms of gengo or use the two systems interchangeably. Emperor Akihito’s era, which began in 1989, is Heisei, making 2019 Heisei 31. \r\n",
      "The new era name is one of biggest changes practically and psychologically for Japan at the start of Crown Prince Naruhito’s reign on May 1. On April 30, Akihito will abdicate, ending an era in the minds of many Japanese. \r\n",
      "The new name is so secret that senior government officials involved in the decision must surrender their cell phones and stay sequestered until it is broadcast, media reports say. \r\n",
      "City offices and government agencies, which mostly use gengo in their computer systems and paperwork, have been preparing for months to avoid glitches. \r\n",
      "To make the transition easier, authorities will announce the new gengo two Chinese characters the cabinet chooses from a short list proposed by scholars a month early, on April 1. \r\n",
      "“We’ve been working on this change for about a year,” said Tsukasa Shizume, an official in the Tokyo suburb of Mitaka, where the era name will be changed on 55 kinds of paperwork in 20 administrative sections. The month-long lead time should be sufficient, he said. \r\n",
      "Fujitsu and NEC Corp. have been helping customers ensure the switch doesn’t crash their systems. Programs have been designed to make it easy to change the gengo, said Shunichi Ueda, an NEC official. \r\n",
      "“If people want to test their computer systems, they can use a trial gengo and see if it works,” he said. \r\n",
      "Most major companies use the Western calendar in their computer systems, so it won’t affect them as much, although smaller companies might run into some problems, he said. \r\n",
      "In Tokyo’s Minato ward, officials will cross out Heisei on thousands of documents and stamp the new gengo above it. \r\n",
      "NATIONAL MOOD \r\n",
      "The era name is more than just a way of counting years for many Japanese. \r\n",
      "It’s a word that captures the national mood of a period, similar to the way “the ‘60s” evokes particular feelings or images, or how historians refer to Britain’s “Victorian” or “Edwardian” eras, tying the politics and culture of a period to a monarch. \r\n",
      "“It’s a way of dividing history,” said Jun Iijima, a 31-year-old lawyer who was born the last year of Showa, the era of Akihito’s father, Emperor Hirohito. “If you were just counting years, the Western system might be sufficient. But gengo gives a certain meaning to a historical period.” \r\n",
      "The 64-year Showa era, which lasted until 1989, has generally come to be identified with Japan’s recovery and rising global prominence in the decades after World War Two. \r\n",
      "The imperial era name is also a form of “soft nationalism,” said Ken Ruoff, director of the Center for Japanese Studies at Portland State University. \r\n",
      "“It’s one of these constant low-level reminders that Japan counts years differently and Japan has a monarchy,” he said. \r\n",
      "The gengo characters are carefully chosen with an aspirational meaning. Heisei, which means “achieving peace,” began on Jan. 8, 1989, amid high hopes that Japan would play a greater role in global affairs after decades of robust economic growth. \r\n",
      "Soon afterward, Japan’s economic bubble popped, ushering in a long period of stagnation and deflation. The rise of China and South Korea diminished Japan’s international prominence, and a series of disasters - including the 1995 Kobe earthquake and 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crises - has marred Heisei’s image. \r\n",
      "FADING USE \r\n",
      "In daily life, usage of the gengo system is slowly declining as Japan integrates into the global economy. \r\n",
      "A recent Mainichi newspaper survey showed that 34 percent of people said they used mostly gengo, 34 percent said they used both about the same, and 25 percent mainly the Western calendar. In 1975, 82 percent said mostly gengo. Both calendars use Western months. \r\n",
      "Japanese drivers licenses have started to print both dates, instead of just gengo. \r\n",
      "Iijima, the lawyer, says legal paperwork uses the era name because that’s what the court system uses. But in daily life he uses both. For global events, he thinks in terms of the Western calendar - like the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks - and uses both dating systems for domestic events. \r\n",
      "He is indifferent about what characters will be chosen for the next gengo. \r\n",
      "But remembering that his grandparents suffered during World War Two, he hopes that it will be an era without war, that Japan will keep up economically with China and India and that it will grow into a “mature,” more tolerant place. \r\n",
      "“I hope Japan can become a society where minorities can live more easily,” he said. \r\n",

      "Title:  521 Artist Ai Weiwei takes aim at state violence in Mexico with Legos\n",
      "Content:  521 MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Chinese artist Ai Weiwei unveiled a new installation in Mexico that tells the story of 43 students likely massacred five years ago in a case that exposed government stonewalling and complicity in abuses, a frequent theme for the dissident artist. \r\n",
      "The installation features large portraits of the students made from a million multi-colored Legos that hover above a cavernous exhibit space, images that have become seared into the Mexican conscience by grieving family members who often hoist posters with the same images at protests demanding answers for their sons’ disappearance. \r\n",
      "Entitled “Reestablishing Memories,” the work also features a timeline of the 2014 abduction of the trainee-teachers from the all-boys Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers College in southern Mexico and the government’s widely disparaged investigation into the case. \r\n",
      "“Why do we have to do it? Because every crime creates a vacuum and it poisons society,” Ai told reporters at a news conference on Thursday. \r\n",
      "Known for his criticism of Communist-run China’s stifling of free expression, Ai said his latest project was partially inspired by the Chinese government’s refusal to explain its errors following a massive 2008 earthquake in Sichuan in which thousands of students died in government-built schools. \r\n",
      "“It reminded me of the Mexicans who lost their children,” he said, explaining how his own search for answers following the tragedy was stymied. \r\n",
      "An initial Mexican government investigation found that the Ayotzinapa students were abducted by corrupt police who handed them over to a local drug gang. The gang then killed them for reasons that remain unclear and burnt their bodies in a trash dump, discarding the ashes into a nearby river, it concluded. \r\n",
      "But the account was tainted by allegations of torture and the possible involvement of soldiers. \r\n",
      "To date, the remains of just one student have been identified. \r\n",
      "Ai, who was detained by the Chinese government in 2011 and currently lives in Berlin, supervised the creation of the oversized Lego portraits by students from Mexico’s National Autonomous University (UNAM). \r\n",
      "Last year, Ai accused Lego of refusing to directly sell its interlocking plastic toy bricks to him. \r\n",
      "The Danish company said its policy was designed to keep it out of politics, but later reversed its stand in the face of a public backlash. \r\n",
      "“Reestablishing Memories,” which is paired with Ai’s earlier “Wang Family Ancestral Hall” installation, opens on Saturday on the UNAM campus in Mexico City, and will be on display through October. \r\n",

      "Content:  522 CHRISTCHURCH/WELLINGTON, New Zealand (Reuters) - Australian Brenton Harrison Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist, was charged with murder on Saturday after 49 people were killed and dozens wounded in mass shootings at two New Zealand mosques. \r\n",
      "Tarrant, handcuffed and wearing a white prison suit, stood silently in the Christchurch District Court where he was remanded without a plea. He is due back in court on April 5 and police said he was likely to face further charges. \r\n",
      "Friday’s attack, which Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern labelled as terrorism, was the worst ever peacetime mass killing in New Zealand and the country had raised its security threat level to the highest. \r\n",
      "Tarrant has been described as a suspected white supremacist, based on his social media activity. \r\n",
      "Footage of the attack on one of the mosques was broadcast live on Facebook, and a “manifesto” denouncing immigrants as “invaders” was also posted online via links to related social media accounts. \r\n",
      "The video showed a man driving to the Al Noor mosque, entering it and shooting randomly at people with a semi-automatic rifle with high-capacity magazines. Worshippers, possibly dead or wounded, lay on the floor, the video showed. \r\n",
      "At one stage the shooter returns to his car, changes weapons, re-enters the mosque and again begins shooting. The camera attached to his head recording the massacre follows the barrel of his weapon, like some macabre video game. \r\n",
      "Forty-one people were killed at the Al Noor mosque. \r\n",
      "Police said the alleged shooter took seven minutes to travel to the second mosque in the suburb of Linwood, where seven people were killed. No images have emerged from the second mosque. \r\n",
      "Tarrant was arrested in a car, which police said was carrying improvised explosive devices, 36 minutes after they were first called. \r\n",
      "“The offender was mobile, there were two other firearms in the vehicle that the offender was in, and it absolutely was his intention to continue with his attack,” Ardern told reporters in Christchurch on Saturday. \r\n",
      "Ardern’s office said the suspect had sent the “manifesto” in a bulk email that included a generic address for the Prime Minister, the opposition leader, speaker of the parliament and around 70 media outlets a matter of minutes before the attack. \r\n",
      "A spokesman said the email didn’t describe the specific incident and there was “nothing in the content or timing that would have been able to prevent the attack.” \r\n",
      "The staff member monitoring the accounts sent it to parliamentary services as soon as they saw it, who sent it to police, the spokesman said. \r\n",
      "The visiting Bangladesh cricket team was arriving for prayers at one of the mosques when the shooting started but all members were safe, a team coach told Reuters. \r\n",
      "Two other people were in custody and police said they were seeking to understand whether they were involved in any way. \r\n",
      "None of those arrested had a criminal history or were on watchlists in New Zealand or Australia. \r\n",
      "SORROW, SYMPATHY \r\n",
      "Twelve operating theatres worked through the night on the more than 40 people wounded, said hospital authorities. Thirty- six people were still being treated on Saturday, 11 of whom remained in intensive care. One victim died in hospital. \r\n",
      "“Many of the people require multiple trips to the theatre to deal with the complex series of injuries they have,” said Christchurch Hospital’s Chief of Surgery Greg Robertson. \r\n",
      "One victim posted a Facebook video from his hospital bed, asking for prayers for himself, his son and daughter. \r\n",
      "“Hi guys how are you. I am very sorry to miss your calls and text messages...I am really tired...please pray for my son, me and my daughter...I am just posting this video to show you that I am fully ok,” said Wasseim Alsati, who was reportedly shot three times. \r\n",
      "Dozens of people laid flowers at cordons near both mosques in Christchurch, which is still rebuilding after a devastating earthquake in 2011 that killed almost 200 people. \r\n",
      "Wearing a black scarf over her head, Ardern hugged members of the Muslim community at a Christchurch refugee centre, saying she would ensure freedom on religion in New Zealand. \r\n",
      "“I convey the message of love and support on behalf of New Zealand to all of you,” she said. \r\n",
      "The majority of victims were migrants or refugees from countries such as Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Turkey, Somalia and Afghanistan. Muslims account for just over 1 percent of New Zealand’s population. \r\n",
      "“I’m not sure how to deal with this. Forgiving is going to take time,” Omar Nabi, whose father Haji Daoud Nabi was gunned down, told reporters outside the Christchurch court. Nabi’s family left Kabul, Afghanistan, for New Zealand in the 1970s. \r\n",
      "Abdikina Ali-Hassarn and his family moved to New Zealand from Somalia four years ago and were regular worshippers at the Linwood mosque. \r\n",
      "“I can’t even go to the mosque now because I am scared of that happening again,” the 16-year-old told New Zealand television. He said his mother, who was at the Linwood mosque with his father and brother, saw two people shot. \r\n",
      "“She came here for the peace...now she is shocked,” he said, adding his mother was too afraid to leave her house. \r\n",
      "Men and women from the New Zealand Muslim Association in Auckland flew to Christchurch to assist with the funeral rites, washing the bodies, wrapping them in white cloth and taking them to the cemetery. \r\n",
      "None of the bodies had yet been released due to the investigation, leaving families unable to bury their dead within the 24 hours customary in Islam. \r\n",
      "GUN LAW REFORMS \r\n",
      "Ardern said Tarrant was a licensed gun owner who allegedly used five weapons, including two semi-automatic weapons and two shotguns, which had been modified. \r\n",
      "“I can tell you one thing right now, our gun laws will change,” Ardern told reporters, saying a ban on semi-automatic weapons would be considered. \r\n",
      "New Zealand has in the past tried to tighten firearm laws, but a strong gun lobby and culture of hunting has stymied such efforts. There are an estimated 1.5 million firearms in New Zealand, which has a population of only five million, but the country has had low levels of gun violence. \r\n",
      "Tarrant lived in Dunedin, on New Zealand’s South Island, and was a member of the Bruce Rifle Club, according to media reports which quoted club members saying he often practiced shooting an AR-15, which is a lightweight semi-automatic rifle. \r\n",

      "Title:  523 Three days after Christchurch shootings, families wait to bury the victims\n",
      "Content:  523 CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand Mucad Ibrahim was wearing little white socks, the type with the nonstick stripes on the bottom so that toddlers dont slip over, when he was carried out the al-Noor mosque in Christchurch.\r\n",
      "His shoes were still at the entrance, where hed left them when he arrived for Friday prayers with his father and older brother. His big brown eyes, usually alight with laughter, were closed as he was rushed to the ambulance.\r\n",
      "That was the last time his family saw him.\r\n",
      "They hope they will finally get to wash and wrap his tiny body and bury him Monday, much later than is traditional in Islam, which calls for bodies to be interred quickly, preferably within 24 hours.\r\n",
      "Mucad, whose name is pronounced Mouad but who was more commonly called by the Arabic diminutive, Mouadee, was three years old. He was born in New Zealand to a Somali family who had fled fighting in their home country more than 20 years ago.\r\n",
      "Mucad was energetic, playful and liked to smile and laugh a lot, his teenage brother Abdi wrote on Facebook. Will miss you dearly brother.\r\n",
      "He was the youngest of the 50 victims in the attacks on two mosques that have shocked New Zealand and especially this southern city, no stranger to tragedy after a devastating earthquake in 2011 that killed 185 people.\r\n",
      "But just as the Sandy Hook massacre in Connecticut caused particular heartache because of the first grade victims innocence, so too does Mucads death encapsulate the inexplicability of this man-made disaster.\r\n",
      "He could have grown up to be a brilliant doctor or the prime minister, said Mohamud Hassan, a 21-year-old member of the Somali community here, which comprises about 60 families. He shook his head, an expression of the common refrain after all mass shootings: why?\r\n",
      "Mucads father, Adan Ibrahim, had collected him at around noon on Friday to take him to Friday prayers at the mosque, as usual. After prayers, the young men often went to play soccer in Hagley Park across the road, and Mucad often went with Abdi.\r\n",
      "But on Friday, when the gunman stormed into the mosque about 10 minutes into the sermon and started spraying bullets indiscriminately around the mens section, little Mucad appeared to think it was a scene from the kind of video game his old brothers liked to play. He ran toward the gunman, Hassan said. Amid the chaos, his father and brother ran in different directions.\r\n",
      "After the carnage had ended, a worshiper carried him to the arriving medics.\r\n",
      "On Sunday night, Mucads father was waiting at the hospital, hoping to see his smallest son for the first time since he was killed, hoping that tomorrow would be the day he could finally lay his youngest to rest.\r\n",
      "Verily we belong to God and to Him we shall return. Will miss you dearly brother, Abdi wrote.\r\n",
      "There is some frustration among families at the length of time it is taking the authorities to release the bodies.\r\n",
      "Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said during a news conference Sunday that a few bodies would be returned to their families that night, and that she hoped all would be returned by Wednesday.\r\n",
      "Just give us back the bodies, one woman yelled at the TV screen Sunday afternoon as members of the local Indonesian community gathered to support the family of Lilik Abdul Hamid, an engineer for Air New Zealand who was killed in the attacks.\r\n",
      "Some 90 disaster victim identification officers, including 20 from abroad, are working to identify the victims. But Christchurchs Coroner said it was a time-consuming process that included identifying clothing, and obtaining medical records and fingerprints.\r\n",
      "Wally Haumaha, the deputy police commissioner, said he understood that not being able to comply with religious funeral rites was adding to the families trauma.\r\n",
      "Our sole focus is to get their loved ones back and to follow the cultural traditions such as the washing and shrouding of the loved ones, he said Sunday.\r\n",
      "Heavy machinery was being used to dig dozens of graves at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Christchurch, not far from the site of the second mosque to be attacked, in Linwood. A local funeral home has been designated to receive bodies for families to conduct ritual washings.\r\n",
      "But families still dont know where the funerals will be held. The mosques in Christchurch are still closed.\r\n",
      "In front of the al-Noor mosque, where 41 of the victims were killed, streams of people continued to make their way Sunday to the police cordon in the park opposite the mosque. Many laid flowers and left notes expressing condolences or urging them to kia kaha be strong in Maori.\r\n",
      "Some people held signs offering free hugs, others gave out home-baked cookies to victims families. Members of the Black Power, a motorcycle gang, performed a haka, or Maori dance, on the street opposite the mosque. The haka is often performed to show strength and unity.\r\n",
      "And members of the Muslim community streamed back and forth between a family center set up at a community college and the hospital, both across the park from the mosque and the hospital.\r\n",
      "Men of Pakistani heritage wore All Blacks rugby jerseys over their salwar kameez. News Zealanders of Bangladeshi and Syrian and Palestinian and Indian heritage greeted each other with hugs and sorrow. The sounds of Arabic hellos ricocheted around the concrete entrance to the hospital.\r\n",
      "Ibrahim Ali, a Somali community leader, greeted some men he didnt know with hey, where are you from? Auckland, the men in taqiyah, or skullcaps, responded. No, before that. Their families were from Fiji.\r\n",
      "But at this moment, it was clear that they were all New Zealanders.\r\n",
      "This doesnt change my feelings about New Zealand, said Said Abdukadir, whose 70-year-old father was killed in the attacks, which were allegedly perpetrated by an Australian specifically to cause shock in a country often lauded for being a safe haven. Abdukadir was late for mosque that day and pulled up just as the gunman was leaving.\r\n",
      "This is what the terrorist wanted, he said, recalling how his father loved to walk through Hagley Park on his way to the mosque. He wanted us to feel like we are not safe anywhere. But we know what New Zealand is.\r\n",

      "Title:  524 'It doesn't open': Mosque survivors describe terror at door\n",
      "Content:  524 WELLNGTON, New Zealand When the gunman began to attack the Al Noor mosque, Ahmed Alayedy scrambled to get to the nearest emergency exit. He was the first one there.\r\n",
      "\"I tried to open the door,\" he said. \"But it doesn't open.\"\r\n",
      "Alayedy and other survivors of the March 15 mosque attacks in New Zealand have described to The Associated Press a scene of confusion and terror at the door on one side of the main prayer room, in the first accounts of the role the door played.\r\n",
      "Alayedy said so many people began crushing him against the door that some of his ribs cracked. Another survivor, Khaled Alnobani, says he thinks as many as 17 people may have died trying to get out through the door.\r\n",
      "Investigators have likely examined a new electric locking system installed on the door in the days before the attack. The mosque says an electrician disabled that system the day before the attack, although some of those who escaped question whether that was the case. What is clear is that nobody managed to open the door that afternoon.\r\n",
      "With the gunman in the middle of the room, the door represented the only escape route for those on one side of him, at least until people started smashing windows to get out.\r\n",
      "Fifty people were slaughtered by the gunman at two Christchurch mosques during the attack, including 42 who died at Al Noor. Alayedy and others say that if the door had been wide open like it typically was during Friday prayers, many more people might have escaped.\r\n",
      "Shagaf Khan, the president of the Muslim Association of Canterbury which oversees the mosque, said the door was closed and latched much like the front door of a house. He said it wasn't locked, although worshippers may have believed it was in the confusion.\r\n",
      "He said an electrician had tested the new electric locking system on Thursday, and then disengaged it for Friday prayers. He said that to open the door, somebody needed to turn a lever. It was just happenstance, and perhaps the cool weather that day, he said, which meant the door wasn't wide open as usual.\r\n",
      "\"On any other Friday, the door would be open,\" he said. \"But on this Friday, nobody opened that door.\"\r\n",
      "He said he agreed that more people would have escaped if the door had been open.\r\n",
      "\"If it had been completely open, it would have been easy for people to get out,\" he said. \"But nobody was prepared for this. We were prepared for an emergency like a fire or an earthquake, and people would still have time to get out. This is something totally different. You don't put this in your emergency plan.\"\r\n",
      "Alayedy said that in the confusion, he can't be sure if he simply failed to turn the lever properly or if something else stopped the door from opening.\r\n",
      "Alnobani, said he, too, tried to open the door and it didn't work, and he's familiar with the lever. He said he believes the door was electronically locked. Simply pushing a button next to the door would have unlocked it, he said, but nobody knew about the new system.\r\n",
      "Khan said the mosque was in compliance with regulations, which require emergency exits to be clear from objects, easily accessible, and unlocked.\r\n",
      "Police said the scene examination is part of their investigation and they will not be commenting while the investigation is ongoing.\r\n",
      "Robert Wright, the Christchurch City Council head of building consents, said in an email the mosque was in compliance with the Building Act at the time of the attacks and had a valid certificate known as a \"Building Warrant of Fitness.\"\r\n",
      "Alayedy, 30, said that on the day of the attack, he'd been listening to a holy speech by imam Gamal Fouda when he heard six or seven shots. He thought it was an electrical fault at first but then heard screaming and ran for the door.\r\n",
      "\"All the brothers come in behind each other, on top of each other,\" he said.\r\n",
      "Because he couldn't open the door, he said, he tried punching the hexagonal piece of glass in the lower part of the door. When that didn't work, he drove his knee through it, shattering the glass, and then kicked it out. He crawled through and ran for safety.\r\n",
      "Alayedy, a chef from Jordan who moved to New Zealand nine years ago, said he thought about his family back at their house as he ran. His pregnant wife, his 3-year-old son, and the baby daughter they hope to have within the next couple of weeks.\r\n",
      "Behind the mosque, Alayedy said, he began helping people to escape over a fence but couldn't get over it himself because of his injured ribs.\r\n",
      "Another survivor provided a second escape route near the door by diving through a window with his arm wrapped around his eyes. Tarik Chenafa said he heard a tat-tat-tat-tat-tat and knew right away it was a semi-automatic weapon from his two years of compulsory military training in the Algerian army.\r\n",
      "\"I know someone is coming to kill us,\" he said.\r\n",
      "Alnobani said that when he first came to the mosque that Friday, he'd noticed the side door was shut and considered opening it but then saw there were some older worshippers. It was a little cold and windy outside, he figured, so he left it alone.\r\n",
      "Alnobani said he also managed to crawl through the door's smashed glass and run. He returned to help rescue a young boy whose father was shoving him through the opening, he said, and then helped the father as well.\r\n",
      "\"I tried to save the child, and I thought maybe I lose my life,\" he said. \"But I am just alone,\" he said, adding \"He had more than me to lose.\"\r\n",
      "When he tried to help a third person through the opening, Alnobani said, that man was shot. The gunman walked out of the mosque to get another gun from his car, Alnobani said, and began shooting at him when he returned. But he managed to escape, and then drove two injured people to the hospital.\r\n",
      "The gunman acted quickly, mowing down people on both sides of the mosque. On the side opposite from the closed door, some worshippers were able to escape, but the gunman also killed many others as they tried to leave.\r\n",
      "\"And he was actually standing behind them, and he was shooting and shooting and shooting and shooting,\" Fouda, the imam, told the AP after the attack. \"Tragedy. Tragedy.\"\r\n",
      "Brenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old Australian, has been charged with murder in the attack. His next court appearance is scheduled for April 5.\r\n",
      "Chenafa said he's still sad and confused, and finds it hard to sleep. And he doesn't know what to believe about the door.\r\n",
      "\"There will be a lot of waiting to find out the truth,\" he said.\n",

      "Title:  525 How to volunteer to help when natural disasters strike\n",
      "Content:  525 By Christopher Dawson, CNN\r\n",
      "Updated 8:44 AM ET, Tue January 22, 2019\r\n",
      "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\r\n",
      "(CNN)The desperate images from a disaster can pull at the heartstrings. They can fire up average people to head to the scene, get involved and render help. But those altruistic urges often give way to doubt and questions like \"Can I really do it?\" \"Will I really be able to help?\" and \"Do they even need me?\"\r\n",
      "Here's how three volunteers answered those questions when they stepped up to help out in disasters.\r\n",
      "Asia Baez was searching for ways to help with hurricane recovery and found volunteer opportunities through All Hands and Hearts. The 22-year-old just graduated from Hofstra University and wanted to volunteer for part of her gap year before graduate school. It took her less than 10 minutes to sign up online, and within two weeks she received an email confirming the dates she selected. \r\n",
      "\"To me the most valuable thing in the world is time, and of course as a student I didn't have much money to donate for disasters,\" explained Baez, \"So I wanted to offer what I did have, which is me and what I can do to help.\"\r\n",
      "But what could she do? That was the question Baez asked herself. She didn't have skills in carpentry or construction, and she did not look like what she imagined a disaster volunteer to be.\r\n",
      "\"I didn't think I could do the type of work that was needed, because I am small like Peter Pan! But I decided I was going to try.\" Baez told CNN. \"I found out it didn't matter if I couldn't lift the most. I had a pair of hands and I wanted to help. That is what matters.\"\r\n",
      "Baez deployed to Houston for two weeks to help rebuild homes destroyed by Hurricane Harvey. She then decided to help in Puerto Rico for another two weeks. Baez ended up staying for five weeks after growing close to the family whose roof her team was replacing. The Rhode Island native wanted to see the project through to completion.\r\n",
      "Her gap year was now turning into a volunteer year, but Baez signed up for another trip with All Hands and Hearts to help a community in Mexico rebuild from an earthquake that struck years earlier.\r\n",
      "Baez says she is moved by the people she helped, and inspired by those volunteering beside her.\r\n",
      "\"What stuck with me,\" she explained, \"is that it is just ordinary people like you and me who are doing this. We just put our heads together and got it done. You will be able to contribute something, you just have to be willing.\"\r\n",
      "Kathleen Esterly first volunteered on the Gulf Coast, fixing homes for Hurricane Katrina victims. It was years after the hurricane made landfall, and Esterly said she was surprised to see families still living in FEMA trailers. It made an impression on her that others will always need help. She resolved to be ready to answer that call.\r\n",
      "That call came with the fires in California raging hours away from her home. Esterly's daughter, Veronica, prodded her into action by asking her mother how they could help.\r\n",
      "\"I wanted us to go and volunteer together, but I was worried we wouldn't really be able to help,\" Esterly told CNN. \"Not knowing what their needs are or how to help them worried me. So when I got there, I had no idea what to expect and I was really surprised that the organization had everything figured out, with our jobs assigned, disaster training set up and leaders ready to guide us.\"\r\n",
      "Esterly and her daughter volunteered with Samaritan's Purse, helping victims of the Carr Fire go through the ash of their homes to see what could be salvaged. Their week of volunteering extended to multiple weeks as their desire to help grew.\r\n",
      "\"We got hooked with our very first homeowner. They are speechless. They can't believe their eyes when they see this army of volunteers coming to help them,\" Explained Esterly. \"To see them get filled with hope after a few hours, to help with that transformation from such despair, I can't imagine doing anything better.\"\r\n",
      "Esterly's other daughter Tyra joined them on their next volunteer trip, and the family has continued to volunteer with Samaritan's Purse responding to Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael and the Camp Fire.\r\n",
      "\"Doing this together, it is better than vacation in my opinion,\" the mother said. \"It has knit our hearts together in a way I don't think anything else has. What I've seen it do is that it has taken us as a family and made us more real, our conversations are of substance and we are not taking each other for granted.\"\r\n",
      "A long way from retirement\r\n",
      "Bill Blair was watching a college football game on TV when a halftime special showed Team Rubicon helping the recovery efforts after Hurricane Harvey.\r\n",
      "\"I watched it and literally the hair stood up on the back of my neck and I said 'oh my gosh I'm a vet, I'm retired, I could do that,'\" Blair told CNN.\r\n",
      "He completed all the online forms but wasn't sure if he would get the call. But in a little over a week, Blair found himself in Houston rebuilding houses as a volunteer.\r\n",
      "It was surprising to Blair not only that he was needed, but that he was needed so quickly. Once he was on the ground, he was taken aback at the scale of the operation.\r\n",
      "\"The commanding general staff, they really know how to set up in a disaster like this, with so many veterans involved to make it run like a well-oiled operation. They supplied us with everything, tools, food, a place to sleep, you name it, so we could focus on doing the work.\"\r\n",
      "Blair has deployed with Team Rubicon to disasters in Texas, California, North Carolina and Florida. He has seen the operations grow in size with more volunteers arriving each week to relieve exhausted crews.\r\n",
      "\"When I woke up this morning to see the new 50 or 60 people that were getting the orientation as we were leaving, I'm gone going, 'Holy smokes, how are we going to do this?'\" Blair explained while volunteering with Team Rubicon's Hurricane Michael relief in Florida. \"But we will do it because we all we have to. And as the disasters keep rolling, we're still going to be recovering from this one. And then another one is going to hit.\"\r\n",
      "If you decide to volunteer, don't just rush out to the scene to help. It is often challenging for disaster response organizations when spontaneous volunteers just show up and then become a strain on resources and the recovery itself. \r\n",
      "Find an organization working on the ground through groups like NVOAD and VolunteerMatch. Register with them, complete their online training and be patient. It might take some time before the organization can send you where you will be most effective, but the need is great and will be for a long time.\n",

      "Title:  526 Venezuelans find ways to cope with inflation and hunger\n",
      "Content:  526 CARACAS, Venezuela Francibel Contreras brings her three malnourished children to a soup kitchen in the dangerous hillside Caracas slum of Petare where they scoop in spoonfuls of rice and scrambled eggs in what could be their only meal of the day.\r\n",
      "Part of the tragedy of daily life in socialist Venezuela can be glimpsed in this small volunteer soup kitchen in the heart of one of Latin Americas biggest slums, which helps dozens of children as well as unemployed mothers who can no longer feed them.\r\n",
      "Some Venezuelans manage to endure the nations economic meltdown by clinging to the shrinking number of well-paid jobs or by receiving some of the hundreds of millions of dollars sent home by friends and relatives abroad a quantity that has swollen in recent years as millions of Venezuelans have fled.\r\n",
      "But a growing percentage of people across the country, especially in slums like Petare, are struggling to cope.\r\n",
      "Contrerass husband, Jorge Flores, used to have a small stand at a local market selling things like bananas and yucca, eggs and lunchmeat trying to scrape out a profit in a place where hyperinflation often made his wholesale costs double from day to day. Then he was robbed at gunpoint by a local gang. And his brother crashed the motorcycle he used to supply his stand.\r\n",
      "So Flores abandoned the market stall and looked for other work. He does some plumbing jobs and the family has turned its living room into a barbershop, sheltered beneath a corrugated metal roof held down by loose bricks and planks. Its decorated with origami-like stars that the family has made out Venezuelas colorful but rapidly depreciating bolivar bills.\r\n",
      "Our currency is worthless, Contreras said. These days, I prefer trading a bag of flour for a manicure or a haircut.\r\n",
      "The scarcity of milk, medicine and other basics along with routine violence has eroded support for socialist President Nicolas Maduro even in poor neighborhoods like Petare that once were his strongholds. Maduro says theres an opposition-led plot to oust him from power and says U.S. economic sanctions and local opposition sabotage are responsible for the meltdown.\r\n",
      "Various local polls show he retains support from roughly a fifth of the population, many of them ideological stalwarts, government-connected insiders or poor voters dependent on government handouts, including the so-called CLAP boxes of oil, flour, rice, pasta, canned tuna and other goods that arrive several times a year.\r\n",
      "Contreras family of four gets those boxes, but its not enough to get by on for long. For months, theyve been relying on the soup kitchen launched by opposition politicians as the main source of protein for their children. On a recent day, her 7-year-old son Jorbeicker played a pickup soccer game in the hilly, dusty streets in front of her home, while her husband practiced styling his mothers hair.\r\n",
      "Im barely getting by, Flores said, scissors in hand.\r\n",
      "The four-day power outage that brought most of Venezuela to a halt this month added to Flores misery. He wasnt able to use the electric clippers needed to give customers the sort of trims they demand.\r\n",
      "It hit us in a big way, he said. You absolutely need the clippers.\r\n",
      "The couple estimates the power outage cost the family the equivalent of $11 in missed haircuts a significant sum in a country where the minimum wage amounts to $6 a month, even if most people supplement that figure by working side jobs and pooling resources with friends and neighbors.\r\n",
      "Contreras and Flores charge 2,500 bolivars about 70 U.S. cents for a trim. A government-subsidized kilogram of flour can cost almost three times that, and Contreras says that lines for the rationed goods can be endless and she sometimes comes back empty-handed. She also said she feels unsafe in the lines. Dozens of people have been killed in gang crossfires over the years, and some have been crushed to death when lines of shoppers turned into stampedes of desperate looters.\r\n",
      "Next-door neighbor Dugleidi Salcedo sent her 4-year-old daughter to live with an aunt in the city of Maracay, two hours away, because she could no longer feed her. My boys cry, the single mother of four said. But they resist more than her when I tell them that theres no food.\r\n",
      "After walking back from the soup kitchen, she opened the rusty door to her home of scraped, mint-colored walls. Inside, her 11-year-old son Daniel, who was born partially paralyzed and with developmental disabilities, lay on a stained couch while flies flew over his twisted, uncovered legs.\r\n",
      "When she took the lid off a plastic container to show her last bag of flour, a cockroach crawled out, making her jump back and scream.\r\n",
      "This is so tough, she said. I dont have a job. I dont have any money.\r\n",
      "Salcedo used to sell baked goods and juices to neighbors from the window of her kitchen. Then, her fridge broke down and she couldnt find the money to fix it.\r\n",
      "These days, she relies on the kindness of neighbors, or asks a friend who owns a small food shop for credit while she waits for loans from family members in other parts of Venezuela.\r\n",
      "This country has never been as bad, the 28-year-old said. Just buying some rice or flour is something so hard, so expensive, and often, they dont even have any.\r\n",
      "A few days later, thieves broke into the soup kitchen and stole food. Then, a fire broke out in the slum, burning 17 homes to the ground. It was caused by candles that were apparently being used for light after a power outage an almost everyday occurrence in many parts of Venezuela. Opposition lawmaker Manuela Bolivar, whose Nodriza Project runs the soup kitchen, said that when firefighters arrived, they lacked water and had to put out the blaze with dirt.\r\n",
      "Its a social earthquake, Bolivar said.\r\n",
      "They lose their homes. Theyre left in the open air. The soup kitchen was robbed. Its so many adversities: Its the infections, the lack of water and food.\r\n",
      "At an outdoor market a short distance from Petare in the middle-class district of Los Dos Caminos, Carmen Gimenez shopped for carrots and other vegetables for a stew. When her 14-year-old daughter Camila asked if they could take some other products, she told her that they would have to stick to the basics.\r\n",
      "Although she has a job at a bank, she still struggles to make ends meet.\r\n",
      "It doesnt matter where you live. The need is the same, said Gimenez, 43.\r\n",
      "The poor, the rich, and the middle class were all suffering somehow because the government has leveled us all downwards, she adds with anger. How did they dominate us? Through the stomach.\r\n",

      "Today, Koizumi has come out of retirement to join a battle against the entrenched business and political interests he had tangled with in the past. A man known for his simple catchphrases has a new one to impart: Zero nuclear power. \r\n",
      "Eight years after the March 11, 2011, nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, Koizumi is back in the spotlight, trying to harness the publics growing distrust of nuclear power and rid his country of an industry he once promoted as prime minister from 2001 to 2006.\r\n",
      "His reversal on nuclear power reflects a wider reconsideration across Japan after the Fukushima disaster, which was triggered by an earthquake and tsunami.\r\n",
      "A February 2018 poll by Japans Asahi Shimbun newspaper found 61 percent of respondents against the nations nuclear power plants being restarted and 27 percent in support.\r\n",
      "Momentum is building, Koizumi said in an interview. I am getting a strong response. Its only a matter of time.\r\n",
      "Embarrassed by his own role in advocating nuclear power, Koizumi says he has learned from his mistakes. But Japans establishment remains firmly behind nuclear plants, even as other nuclear critics often point out the dangers posed by Japans quakes and tsunamis, a word Japan gave the world.\r\n",
      "The disaster brought a severe crisis, but we can turn crisis into opportunity. We can manage ourselves with renewables, he said. Take Germany, for example. They saw the disaster in Japan and changed their energy policy. But of all countries, Japan has not changed. Its truly incomprehensible.\r\n",
      "[Opinion: Brand Japan is taking a hit]\r\n",
      "Japan shut down all of its 54 reactors after the Fukushima catastrophe. Explosions in three reactors sent a cloud of radioactive dust across vast swaths of northeastern Japan and forced 165,000 people to flee their homes. \r\n",
      "But since Shinzo Abe was reelected prime minister in 2012, his government has been on a mission to get the nuclear power industry back on its feet. \r\n",
      "Nine reactors have already been restarted, six more applications to restart have been approved by a new, nominally independent Nuclear Regulation Authority, and the government wants nuclear power to contribute 20 percent to 22 percent of the nations energy by 2030.\r\n",
      "Japans nuclear agency and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) say safety standards have been significantly tightened. The aim, said Daisuke Matsuno, director of METIs nuclear energy policy planning division, is to make the industry the worlds safest.\r\n",
      "At the same time, it is dangerous to think you can achieve zero risk, said Matsuno.Overconfidence is dangerous.\r\n",
      "Indeed, overconfidence was Japans downfall. \r\n",
      "A damning report by an independent parliamentary panel in 2012 concluded that the Fukushima Daiichi disaster was profoundly man-made, caused by a disregard of the risks of earthquakes by an industry determined to preserve the illusion that nuclear power was absolutely safe.\r\n",
      "Instead of supervising the nuclear power industry, METI colluded with it, the report said. It said the risks of nuclear power were downplayed in a culture of reflexive obedience and a reluctance to question authority.\r\n",
      "METI and Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO), the operator of the Fukushima plant, should have been profoundly embarrassed by those conclusions, Koizumi said, but instead appear unfazed.\r\n",
      "I am stunned, I am stunned, he said, waving his arms in animation.\r\n",
      "I think they are crazy. Everyone at METI and TEPCO are all smart. They all did well in school. Still they dont get it, they dont get how this is costing so much money and is so risky, he added.\r\n",
      "So why are elected politicians so determined to press ahead? The answer, Koizumi asserted, lies in those same vested interests he has spent the best part of his career fighting.\r\n",
      "Building nuclear power plants is hugely expensive and involves large swaths of industry, which in turn supports the ruling party, Koizumi said. Labor unions eyeing jobs from nuclear power support the opposition parties, most of whom had backed nuclear power in the past.\r\n",
      "Nuclear power is behind both sides, he said. \r\n",
      "Since the disaster of 2011, the opposition has swung into the antinuclear camp. But Koizumi has found his own Liberal Democratic Party also the party of Abe harder to sway. \r\n",
      "So much money has also been invested in the industry that there is a reluctance to write investments off. But Koizumi says nuclear power is neither economic nor necessary. The country, he noted, survived without it for two years without a single blackout.\r\n",
      "Koizumis journey to the zero nuclear camp began on the day the Fukushima nuclear plant ruptured. In retirement, he has devoured books on the subject, and has come to the belief that the world had next to no provisions to safely store nuclear waste.\r\n",
      "[Gallery: Children of Fukushima battle an invisible enemy]\r\n",
      "Public pressure and litigation in Japan have delayed or prevented several plants from restarting, but critics say risks from earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are still being systematically downplayed. \r\n",
      "One concern is it will take so long to overcome safety concerns and public opposition that the government will never meet its 2030 target for nuclear power. Although Japan is also investing in renewable energy, the shortfall is likely to be made up with fossil fuels, experts say. That would be a quick fix, but a huge setback for Japans promises under the Paris climate accord.\r\n",
      "Koizumi says he has told Abe to embrace renewable energy much more forcefully.\r\n",
      "If Japan went in that direction, the world would look at us differently, with more respect, he said. We can become a model for others to follow.\r\n",
      "Other voices of criticism struggle to be heard.\r\n",
      "Shigeaki Koga, an energy industry expert, says his career was sidelined at METI after he expressed doubts about the safety of nuclear power, until he was ultimately forced to resign. He has since emerged as a leading public critic of nuclear power.\r\n",
      "Kunihiko Shimazaki, one of Japans leading seismologists, warned of the risks of earthquakes and tsunamis along the countrys northeast coast for years before the disaster struck, but his reports were generally ignored or buried. After March 2011, he served for two years with the nuclear regulator, and spoke out forcefully, but his term was not renewed.\r\n",
      "For now, Koizumi is leading the charge and trying to appeal directly to the Japanese people, as he did when he called for a snap election as prime minister in 2005 to push through postal privatization.\r\n",
      "As someone who believes he was deceived by the nuclear power lobby during his time as prime minister, he sees it as his duty.\r\n",
      "Just as Confucius said, for someone not to correct themselves after making a mistake that is a true mistake.\r\n",

      "Title:  528 Despite being exposed, fake news thrives on social media ahead of India polls\n",
      "Content:  528 MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Two weeks after a suicide bombing in Kashmir in February killed 40 Indian policemen, a Facebook user called Avi Dandiya posted a live video in which he played a recording of a call purportedly involving India’s home minister, the president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and an unidentified woman. \r\n",
      "The trio could be heard talking about arousing nationalist sentiment ahead of India’s general election, with the BJP president allegedly saying in Hindi: “We agree that for election, we need a war”. \r\n",
      "Within 24 hours, one of Facebook Inc’s fact-checking partners in India, BOOM, exposed Dandiya’s video as fake. An analysis on BOOM’s website said the video was created by splicing audio from older political interviews. \r\n",
      "By the time Facebook took down the post, it had received more than 2.5 million views and 150,000 shares. There is no Indian law that specifically targets fake news, but police in New Delhi registered a case of forgery against Dandiya and an official said investigations were ongoing. \r\n",
      "Still, Reuters last week found at least four edited copies of Dandiya’s videos on Facebook with about 36,000 views. One on Google’s YouTube has been seen 2,800 times while another on Twitter has 22,000 views. \r\n",
      "Messages and e-mails to Dandiya, an avid Facebook user who last appeared in a live video on March 23, went unanswered. The home ministry, the BJP president and party’s information-technology chief did not respond to requests for comment. \r\n",
      "The videos underline how social media companies are struggling with fake news in India despite saying they’ve taken steps to tackle the menace ahead of India’s general election, which starts on April 11. \r\n",
      "With 900 million people eligible to vote and an estimated half-a-billion with access to the internet, fake news can have an enormous impact on the election. Dandiya’s video, for example, could have seriously damaged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP if enough people thought it was true. \r\n",
      "Policing content has become a massive global problem for social media giants which have no template for consistently preventing online fake news or eliminating it. \r\n",
      "Fierce internet disinformation battles gripped countries such as Brazil and Malaysia last year ahead of elections. Authorities in Indonesia and the EU, which are due to hold polls, have warned of the threat of fake news. \r\n",
      "In India, Facebook has partnered with fact checkers and, like Twitter, ramped up efforts to block fake accounts. \r\n",
      "On Monday, Facebook said it had deleted 1,126 accounts, groups and pages in India and Pakistan for “inauthentic behaviour” and spamming, many linked to India’s opposition Congress party. \r\n",
      "Google has partnered with fact-checkers to train 10,000 journalists this year to better tackle fake news. \r\n",
      "Facebook’s popular messaging app WhatsApp has launched newspaper and radio campaigns to deter the spread of misinformation. \r\n",
      "Social media companies say they don’t outrightly remove all fake posts as that would jeopardise free speech. Facebook has said that circulation of posts which are debunked, or discovered to be fake, is reduced by more than 80 percent. \r\n",
      "NO SILVER BULLET \r\n",
      "Posts that violate Facebook’s community guidelines, including hate speech or content that could incite violence, are completely deleted, the company said, adding that Dandiya’s video came under that category. \r\n",
      "But even when content has been identified as fake and removed, slightly modified versions of the same images, video or text can escape detection and spread further. \r\n",
      "“This is a highly adversarial space, so we still miss things and won’t catch everything - but we’re making progress,” said a Facebook spokeswoman, who added that the overall volume of false news had been reduced on the platform. \r\n",
      "“There’s no silver bullet solution in fighting misinformation.” \r\n",
      "Twitter said it deeply cares about the potentially harmful effects of misinformation and encourages users not to share unverified information. \r\n",
      "A YouTube spokesman said the company will continue to embrace the “democratization of access to information” while providing a reliable service to users. \r\n",
      "Twitter and YouTube did not comment on Dandiya’s video. \r\n",
      "SHOWN TO BE FALSE \r\n",
      "Another fake post that went viral recently was on popular Indian student leader Kanhaiya Kumar, who was arrested and charged with sedition after a 2016 rally to commemorate the execution of a Kashmiri separatist. Opposition parties said Kumar’s arrest by federal police was an attempt by authorities to curb free speech. \r\n",
      "Some Facebook posts in February described Kumar as anti-India and showed his photo in front of a map that depicted some Indian states as part of Pakistan. Two Facebook fact-checkers in India investigated the posts and said the image was doctored. \r\n",
      "Still, a month later, Reuters found at least two copies of those posts on Facebook with 375 comments and 1,500 shares. \r\n",
      "Facebook in February announced an expansion of its fact-checking company partners to seven, from two. Facebook says it also issues an alert to users who try to share a post which its fact-checkers have debunked, but doesn’t prohibit further sharing. \r\n",
      "Reuters found that when debunked posts of Kumar were shared, an alert popped up with a link to the fact-checkers’ analysis. However, all four variants of Dandiya’s videos could be shared without such fake news alerts from Facebook. \r\n",
      "“There is no way you can solve this problem (quickly) ... the magnitude of the problem is really huge,” said Kanchan Kaur, a Bengaluru-based assessor at International Fact-Checking Network at U.S.-based Poynter Institute. \r\n",
      "FACT-CHECKING BUSINESS \r\n",
      "When tensions rose between India and Pakistan in February following a suicide bombing in Kashmir and cross-border air strikes, social media was flooded with fake news - old videos of captured pilots and photos of earthquake-hit regions were spread as depicting current events. \r\n",
      "“Since Pulwama we’ve been working seven days a week,” said Jency Jacob, managing editor at BOOM, referring to the site of the suicide attack. \r\n",
      "On a recent visit to BOOM’s office in India’s financial capital Mumbai, five people were seen monitoring and analysing online content. One of the rooms served as BOOM’s studio where television-style news videos are shot on debunked stories and published on its website. \r\n",
      "As an industry, fact-checking is fast spreading in India. \r\n",
      "British broadcaster BBC has in-house fact checking operations and a dedicated WhatsApp number where anyone can flag suspected fake posts for further checks. \r\n",
      "“A dedicated team of journalists is debunking fake news daily, and also writing detailed explainers on controversial issues and claims,” BBC’s India Digital Editor, Milind Khandekar, told Reuters. \r\n",
      "Former software engineer Pratik Sinha and his mother are part of a 10-member fact checking initiative named “Alt News” which is run from a two-bedroom-flat in the western city of Ahmedabad. \r\n",
      "Using online video verification and social media tracking tools, Sinha said his team debunks up to four posts each day. \r\n",
      "Debunked posts appearing online has become a problem even for India’s Election Commission. \r\n",
      "In February, a WhatsApp message called for spreading the word that said Indians living overseas could “now vote online for 2019 elections” and should register on the Commission’s website. The Commission called it “FAKE NEWS” on Twitter and filed a police complaint against “unknown persons” for public mischief. \r\n",
      "A month later, the message continues to circulate on Facebook - a user who shared it on March 23 has so far received 42 likes and 19 shares. When someone questioned the post, the Facebook user responded: “I think you can vote. Just check the web site and follow the steps”. \r\n",

      "Title:  529 'It doesn't open': Mosque survivors describe terror at door\n",
      "Content:  529 WELLNGTON, New Zealand When the gunman began to attack the Al Noor mosque, Ahmed Alayedy scrambled to get to the nearest emergency exit. He was the first one there.\r\n",
      "I tried to open the door, he said. But it doesnt open.\r\n",
      "Alayedy and other survivors of the March 15 mosque attacks in New Zealand have described to The Associated Press a scene of confusion and terror at the door on one side of the main prayer room, in the first accounts of the role the door played.\r\n",
      "Alayedy said so many people began crushing him against the door that some of his ribs cracked. Another survivor, Khaled Alnobani, says he thinks as many as 17 people may have died trying to get out through the door.\r\n",
      "Investigators have likely examined a new electric locking system installed on the door in the days before the attack. The mosque says an electrician disabled that system the day before the attack, although some of those who escaped question whether that was the case. What is clear is that nobody managed to open the door that afternoon.\r\n",
      "With the gunman in the middle of the room, the door represented the only escape route for those on one side of him, at least until people started smashing windows to get out.\r\n",
      "Fifty people were slaughtered by the gunman at two Christchurch mosques during the attack, including 42 who died at Al Noor. Alayedy and others say that if the door had been wide open like it typically was during Friday prayers, many more people might have escaped.\r\n",
      "Shagaf Khan, the president of the Muslim Association of Canterbury which oversees the mosque, said the door was closed and latched much like the front door of a house. He said it wasnt locked, although worshippers may have believed it was in the confusion.\r\n",
      "He said an electrician had tested the new electric locking system on Thursday, and then disengaged it for Friday prayers. He said that to open the door, somebody needed to turn a lever. It was just happenstance, and perhaps the cool weather that day, he said, which meant the door wasnt wide open as usual.\r\n",
      "On any other Friday, the door would be open, he said. But on this Friday, nobody opened that door.\r\n",
      "He said he agreed that more people would have escaped if the door had been open.\r\n",
      "If it had been completely open, it would have been easy for people to get out, he said. But nobody was prepared for this. We were prepared for an emergency like a fire or an earthquake, and people would still have time to get out. This is something totally different. You dont put this in your emergency plan.\r\n",
      "Alayedy said that in the confusion, he cant be sure if he simply failed to turn the lever properly or if something else stopped the door from opening.\r\n",
      "Alnobani, said he, too, tried to open the door and it didnt work, and hes familiar with the lever. He said he believes the door was electronically locked. Simply pushing a button next to the door would have unlocked it, he said, but nobody knew about the new system.\r\n",
      "Khan said the mosque was in compliance with regulations, which require emergency exits to be clear from objects, easily accessible, and unlocked.\r\n",
      "Police said the scene examination is part of their investigation and they will not be commenting while the investigation is ongoing.\r\n",
      "Robert Wright, the Christchurch City Council head of building consents, said in an email the mosque was in compliance with the Building Act at the time of the attacks and had a valid certificate known as a Building Warrant of Fitness.\r\n",
      "Alayedy, 30, said that on the day of the attack, hed been listening to a holy speech by imam Gamal Fouda when he heard six or seven shots. He thought it was an electrical fault at first but then heard screaming and ran for the door.\r\n",
      "All the brothers come in behind each other, on top of each other, he said.\r\n",
      "Because he couldnt open the door, he said, he tried punching the hexagonal piece of glass in the lower part of the door. When that didnt work, he drove his knee through it, shattering the glass, and then kicked it out. He crawled through and ran for safety.\r\n",
      "Alayedy, a chef from Jordan who moved to New Zealand nine years ago, said he thought about his family back at their house as he ran. His pregnant wife, his 3-year-old son, and the baby daughter they hope to have within the next couple of weeks.\r\n",
      "Behind the mosque, Alayedy said, he began helping people to escape over a fence but couldnt get over it himself because of his injured ribs.\r\n",
      "Another survivor provided a second escape route near the door by diving through a window with his arm wrapped around his eyes. Tarik Chenafa said he heard a tat-tat-tat-tat-tat and knew right away it was a semi-automatic weapon from his two years of compulsory military training in the Algerian army.\r\n",
      "I know someone is coming to kill us, he said.\r\n",
      "Alnobani said that when he first came to the mosque that Friday, hed noticed the side door was shut and considered opening it but then saw there were some older worshippers. It was a little cold and windy outside, he figured, so he left it alone.\r\n",
      "Alnobani said he also managed to crawl through the doors smashed glass and run. He returned to help rescue a young boy whose father was shoving him through the opening, he said, and then helped the father as well.\r\n",
      "I tried to save the child, and I thought maybe I lose my life, he said. But I am just alone, he said, adding He had more than me to lose.\r\n",
      "When he tried to help a third person through the opening, Alnobani said, that man was shot. The gunman walked out of the mosque to get another gun from his car, Alnobani said, and began shooting at him when he returned. But he managed to escape, and then drove two injured people to the hospital.\r\n",
      "The gunman acted quickly, mowing down people on both sides of the mosque. On the side opposite from the closed door, some worshippers were able to escape, but the gunman also killed many others as they tried to leave.\r\n",
      "And he was actually standing behind them, and he was shooting and shooting and shooting and shooting, Fouda, the imam, told the AP after the attack. Tragedy. Tragedy.\r\n",
      "Brenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old Australian, has been charged with murder in the attack. His next court appearance is scheduled for April 5.\r\n",
      "Chenafa said hes still sad and confused, and finds it hard to sleep. And he doesnt know what to believe about the door.\r\n",
      "There will be a lot of waiting to find out the truth, he said.\r\n",

      "Content:  530 Six months after Palu was ripped apart by an earthquake, tsunami and liquefying soil that sucked neighborhoods into the earth and killed thousands, a second crisis is looming as recovery efforts stumble and a city that feels ignored begs for humanitarian assistance.\r\n",
      "Thousands of people in this city on Indonesia's Sulawesi island are still living in sweltering tent cities, while construction of new permanent homes has yet to start and almost a third of temporary housing is unoccupied after aid groups and authorities failed to connect the units to essential utilities.\r\n",
      "President Joko Widodo, who is seeking a second term in elections this week, and his deputy promised that financial assistance to those whose homes were destroyed or whose loved ones were killed would be rapidly distributed. But not a cent has been paid out.\r\n",
      "\"It's like we're forgotten,\" said Ade Zahra, a mother of eight living in a tent city who says it's a miracle her family survived when the quake turned their village to mud and engulfed their home.\r\n",
      "\"We've received no more assistance in the past two months, not only the government, but also humanitarian groups and volunteers who used to provide a lot,\" she said.\r\n",
      "The city's struggle to recover highlights a broader problem of neglect often suffered by remote regions in Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago home to hundreds of ethnic groups. Far from the center of economic, political and cultural power in populous Java, the region around Palu has a history of sectarian conflict and perceived indifference to its plight could embolden hard-liners.\r\n",
      "City officials, meanwhile, are worried frustration among the displaced has reached a breaking point.\r\n",
      "As anger among the refugees simmers, Widodo is focused on securing his reelection. Sulawesi mostly voted for Widodo in 2014, but he risks losing ground there this time. That could be crucial if the race is tighter than polls, which are predicting a strong Widodo victory.\r\n",
      "The Sept. 28 earthquake spawned a large localized tsunami that wiped out coastal areas, while liquefaction caused by the shaking turned entire neighborhoods into rivers of sludge. The disaster killed more than 4,400 people, making it the world's deadliest seismic event in 2018.\r\n",
      "The central government, at the time still grappling with the aftermath of deadly earthquakes on Lombok Island, appealed for international aid but didn't declare a national disaster, which would've opened the door wider to foreign assistance. It prohibited international aid organizations from operating on the ground.\r\n",
      "Though the tragedy is fading from the national consciousness, large parts of Palu look like they were struck only yesterday, a daily reminder to residents of the horrors they lived through.\r\n",
      "About 90% of roads have been repaired, according to Palu's mayor, but the shoreline is littered in debris and hollowed out buildings that lean precariously.\r\n",
      "Waves wash inside Apung Palu Mosque, which once sat majestically on pillars in Palu Bay. People looking for valuables pick through a vast jumble of personal belongings and house debris, all that's left of once thriving communities.\r\n",
      "In Sigi district bordering Palu, several dozen white tents emblazoned with the U.N. refugee agency's logo are home to hundreds of evacuees, who look with envy and anger at temporary housing across the road some of it occupied, some empty and some still unfinished.\r\n",
      "During the day, the tents are blazing hot and at night refugees, who include a man incapacitated by a stroke and a boy with cerebral palsy, shiver.\r\n",
      "Frustrated residents recall that not long after the disaster Vice President Jusuf Kalla visited and promised they'd soon get money to help rebuild their lives. Instead things seem to be getting worse.\r\n",
      "They have clean drinking water, but a mobile kitchen provided by an aid group closed due to lack of donations. Members of some families have jobs, but others have almost nothing, their former livelihoods gone. Some beg for money.\r\n",
      "Zahra, the mother of eight, said she hopes the government finally fulfills its promise.\r\n",
      "\"Have mercy on us,\" she said.\r\n",
      "Officially, about 173,000 people were displaced by the disaster and about 20,000 are still living in tents that Palu's mayor says were designed to last three months. The actual number without stable housing is much higher.\r\n",
      "At a block of eight buildings built by a charitable foundation run by Kalla's business empire, a banner announced they were handed over to the city on Feb. 14. All sit empty and unconnected to utilities, the only sign of life a few cows grazing between them.\r\n",
      "Temporary housing built nearby by another organization is occupied, some by residents of a neighborhood wiped out by liquefaction.\r\n",
      "Umira, who uses a single name, wept as she recalled the ordeal her family has endured since the night they fled a sea of moving trees and houses. Eight of her relatives were killed, including her grandson.\r\n",
      "They've gone from sheltering in a sports stadium to fashioning their own makeshift lodging in the ruins of a house to finally being assigned to a room in a temporary housing unit.\r\n",
      "\"We all cried with happiness,\" she said of the moment two months ago when they learned they would have housing. \"Even my husband cried and hugged the wall of our new home.\"\r\n",
      "The family still gets aid, Umira said, such as staple foods and cooking oil, though it's distributed without any predictable schedule.\r\n",
      "When the aid runs out they rely on income from running an on-call motorcycle taxi service.\r\n",
      "\"If there is a call, we can eat,\" she said. \"If not, we will only eat rice with salt.\"\r\n",
      "Presley Tampubolon, the head of Palu's disaster agency who oversees temporary housing, said the need for accommodation has been greater than anticipated.\r\n",
      "For every house destroyed or damaged, there would often be several generations of a family living in it. He said it would be \"inhuman\" to expect such families to fit into the 3-meter-by-4-meter (10-foot-by-13-foot) rooms that have been built.\r\n",
      "He said the government and aid groups have built temporary buildings with 5,300 total rooms that can accommodate nearly 41,000 people. But about 1,600 of those rooms are empty because they weren't connected to water, electricity or sanitation, he said.\r\n",
      "Hidayat, the mayor of Palu who uses a single name, said the central government has stopped building temporary homes despite the need and construction of permanent dwellings hasn't started.\r\n",
      "Compounding the problem is that the central government's social affairs and public works ministries haven't released \"mourning allowances\" and funds for people to build new homes.\r\n",
      "He said he's worried anger will soon boil over.\r\n",
      "The social affairs ministry's director of social protection and disaster victims, Margo Wiyono, said the ministry has verified 1,906 of the 4,400 names of heirs who would be entitled to mourning allowances and has proposed the finance ministry pay them.\r\n",
      "He said they were still investigating the rest.\r\n",
      "\"We don't want the allowances worth 15 million rupiah ($1,050) per heir to fall into the hands of irresponsible people,\" he said.\r\n",
      "The budget director-general at the finance ministry, Askolani, said it's in the process of approving money to pay the allowances. He said releasing funds for new housing is contingent on several factors, including reviewing local government data and identifying areas for new settlements that are safe from liquefaction.\r\n",

      "Title:  531 Near site of Fukushima nuclear disaster, a shattered town and scattered lives\n",
      "Content:  531 NAMIE, Japan   Noboru Honda lost 12 members of his extended family when a tsunami struck the Fukushima prefecture in northern Japan nearly eight years ago. Last year, he was diagnosed with cancer and initially given a few months to live.  \r\n",
      "Today, he is facing a third sorrow: Watching what may be the last gasps of his hometown.\r\n",
      "For six years, Namie was deemed unsafe after a multiple-reactor meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant following a 2011 earthquake and tsunami. \r\n",
      "In March 2017, the government lifted its evacuation order for the center of Namie. But so far, hardly anyone has ventured back.\r\n",
      "Its people are scattered and divided. Families are split. The sense of community is coming apart.\r\n",
      "It has been eight years; we were hoping things would be settled now, the 66-year-old Honda said. This is the worst time, the most painful period.\r\n",
      "For the people of Namie and other towns near the Fukushima plant, the pain is sharpened by the way the Japanese government is trying to move beyond the tragedy, to use the 2020 Tokyo Olympics as a symbol of hope and recovery,a signthat life can return to normal after a disaster of this magnitude.\r\n",
      "Its charm offensive is also tied up with efforts to restart the countrys nuclear-power industry, one of the worlds most extensive networks of atomic power generation.\r\n",
      "Six Olympic softball games and a baseball game will be staged in Fukushima, the prefectures bustling and radiation-free capital city, and the Olympic torch relay will start from here.\r\n",
      "But in Namie, much closer to the ill-fated nuclear plant, that celebration rings hollow, residents say.\r\n",
      "This was a close-knit community of farmers, fishermen and potters of orchards, rice paddies and cattle sandwiched between the mountains and the sea. It was a place where people celebrated and mourned as a community, and families lived together across generations. \r\n",
      "Thats all gone. On the main street, a small new shopping arcade has opened. But a short walk away, a barber shop stands abandoned, its empty chairs gathering years of dust. A sign telling customers to make themselves at home is still displayed in a bar, but inside debris litters the floor. A karaoke parlor is boarded up. Wild boars, monkeys and palm civets still roam the streets, residents say.\r\n",
      "Just 873 people, or under 5 percent, of an original population of 17,613 have returned. Many are scared with some obvious justification that their homes and surroundings are still unsafe. Most of the returnees are elderly. Only six children are enrolled at the gleaming new elementary school. This is not a place for young families.\r\n",
      "Four-fifths of Namies geographical area is mountain and forest, impossible to decontaminate, still deemed unsafe to return. When it rains, the radioactive cesium in the mountains flows into rivers and underground water sources close to the town.\r\n",
      "Greenpeace has been taking thousands of radiation readings for years in the towns around the Fukushima nuclear plant. It says radiation levels in parts of Namie where evacuation orders have been lifted will remain well above international maximum safety recommendations for many decades, raising the risks of leukemia and other cancers to unjustifiable levels, especially for children.\r\n",
      "In the rural areas around the town, radiation levels are much higher and could remain unsafe for people to live beyond the end of this century, Greenpeace concluded in a 2018 report.\r\n",
      "The scale of the problem is clearly not something the government wants to communicate to the Japanese people, and thats driving the whole issue of the return of evacuees, said Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist with Greenpeace. The idea that an industrial accident closes off an area of Japan, with its limited habitable land, for generations and longer that would just remind the public why they are right to be opposed to nuclear power.\r\n",
      "Today, Namies former residents are scattered across all but one of Japans 47 prefectures. Many live in the nearby town of Nihonmatsu, in comfortable but isolating apartment blocks where communal space and interaction are limited. With young people moving away, the elderly, who already feel the loss of Namie most acutely, find themselves even more alone.\r\n",
      "People are losing the purposes of living. The more time that passes, they feel their dignity as human beings is lost, said Shigeru Sasaki, a former farmer from Namie.\r\n",
      "As a community, we were already suffering from an aging population, said Katsunobu Sakurai, former mayor of the nearby town of Minamisoma. Now, the damage is more severe because young people are not returning. The elderly who come back feel pessimism and depression. The biggest tragedy now is the high rate of suicides.\r\n",
      "Kazuhiro Yoshida, the embattled mayor of Namie, said fears about radiation are not the only reason people arent returning; many complain the deserted town lacks amenities.\r\n",
      "He has managed to get a medical clinic reopened, and hopes a supermarket will finally reopen despite the lack of residents. But an elder-care facility remains shuttered because the owner can barely find workers, he said.\r\n",
      "For the past eight years, we have seen the destruction of the area, the destruction of the community, and it will be difficult to bring people back, he said. But throughout history, we have been through many hardships. If we give up, we would lose our town, and as mayor, I will work with all my heart to prevent that.\r\n",
      "But many residents say the central government is being heavy handed in its attempts to convince people to return, failing to support residents efforts to build new communities in places like Nihonmatsu, and then ending compensation payments within a year of evacuation orders being lifted. \r\n",
      "We are upset. Everyone is upset, said Sasaki, the former farmer. \r\n",
      "In other towns around the nuclear plant, people have complained that arbitrarily decided compensation payouts more for people deemed to have been in radiation-affected zones, far less for tsunami victims, nothing for people just a mile outside the zone most affected have divided communities and caused resentment and friction.\r\n",
      "The government is building and fortifying sea walls along hundreds of miles of the Pacific coast to prevent another tsunami from wreaking havoc, but some residents say they werent consulted and arent happy about being shut off from the sea. \r\n",
      "This is a place desperate to attract people to return, but this reduces our attractiveness for young people, said Riken Komatsu in the fishing port of Onahama, who is working to rebuild a sense of community and raise awareness about problems with the reconstruction effort.\r\n",
      "Komatsu says reconstruction has been imposed from above, a problem he says reflects, in a broader sense, what Japan is like. \r\n",
      "We are going through a second sense of loss because this is not the reconstruction we wanted, he said.\r\n",
      "Today, Hondas home, ruined by the tsunami, has been bulldozed to make way for new houses. But so far none have been built.\r\n",
      "We were driven out of our community, and had it destroyed, he said. We asked the town and the prefecture to re-create a community for us, away from home, but we were not listened to.\r\n",

      "Content:  532 CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand They had walked that once innocuous stretch of sidewalk side-by-side so many times. Every Friday, Yasir Amin and his dad had ambled along the path toward the mosque where they prayed together in peace, a routine so serene and so ordinary that Amin was nearly blinded by confusion when the man drove up with the gun.\r\n",
      "Amin and his father, Muhammad Amin Nasir, were just 200 meters from the Al Noor mosque on Friday when everything went wrong. They had no idea that a white supremacist had just slaughtered at least 41 people inside the mosque's hallowed halls, or that more people would be killed at a second mosque soon after. All they knew was that a car that had been driving by had suddenly stopped. And a man was leaning out the car's window, pointing a gun at them.\r\n",
      "\"RUN!\" Amin screamed.\r\n",
      "The bullets began to fly. The men began to run. But at 67, Nasir couldn't keep up with his 35-year-old son. And so he fell behind, by two or three fateful steps.\r\n",
      "Amid the blasts, Amin turned to scream at his father to get down on the ground. But his father was already falling.\r\n",
      "The gunman drove away. A pool of blood poured from Nasir's body.\r\n",
      "\"Daddy!\" Amin screamed. \"Daddy! DADDY!\"\r\n",
      "Amin had never seen anyone shot before. He left Pakistan for Christchurch five years ago, and was embraced by a multicultural city that felt like the safest place on earth. His father, who farms vegetables, wheat and rice back in Pakistan, also fell for the leafy green city at the bottom of the world.\r\n",
      "And so Nasir began making routine visits to see his son, sometimes spending up to six months in New Zealand before returning to Pakistan to tend to his crops. Nasir had been in town only three weeks for his most recent visit when he was shot three times on the street of the city he had adopted as a second home.\r\n",
      "From the ground, Nasir stared up at his son, unable to speak, tears running down his face. Amin ran to his car to grab his phone and called the police. Officers quickly arrived, and soon the father and son were in an ambulance racing to the hospital.\r\n",
      "Nasir had always been more than just a dad to Amin. When Amin was just 6, his mother died, leaving Nasir to raise him along with his four siblings. Nasir became both a father and a mother, a reliable source of laughter with a huge heart. He embraced Amin's new community of New Zealand friends as if they were his own family. And in turn, the community embraced Nasir — so much so, that it initially confused him.\r\n",
      "The elder man was baffled by the constant chipper greetings of \"Hello!\" he received whenever he dropped Amin's children off at school. Why do they keep saying that to me? he asked his son. Amused, Amin explained that the locals were simply trying to welcome him, their own version of the Arabic peace greeting, \"As-Salaam-Alaikum.\"\r\n",
      "Amin chuckled at the memory on Saturday, one day after he brought his father to the hospital. Nasir remains in an induced coma with critical injuries, though his condition has stabilized. The bullets pierced his shoulder, chest and back.\r\n",
      "Like many other victims struggling to cope with the horrific events of Friday that left 49 dead, Amin made his way to Hagley College near the hospital. The college was serving as a community center for the grieving, and members of the public poured in with meals and drinks, doling out hugs and words of support to those in need.\r\n",
      "Outside the college, Javed Dadabhai mourned for his gentle cousin, 35-year-old Junaid Mortara, who is believed to have died in the first mosque attack. As of Saturday, many families were still waiting to find out if their loved ones were alive.\r\n",
      "\"He's very punctual, so he would've been there at a dime. He would've been there at 1:30,\" Dadabhai said, a reference to the time of the attack, which began soon after.\r\n",
      "His cousin was the breadwinner of the family, supporting his mother, his wife and their three children, ages 1 to 5. Mortara had inherited his father's convenience store, which was covered in flowers on Saturday.\r\n",
      "Mortara was an avid cricket fan, and would always send a sparring text with relatives over cricket matches when Canterbury was facing Auckland.\r\n",
      "\"The sad thing is he was actually due to come up to Auckland next weekend for a family wedding,\" Dadabhai said. \"We were due to have a catch-up. But I never knew a more shy, soft-spoken kind of person. ... As cousins, you'd kind of make fun of the fact when someone's so gentle like that, but he's leaving a huge void.\"\r\n",
      "The long wait for information on the status of the dead was particularly painful because Muslim tradition calls for burials within 24 hours of a person's death.\r\n",
      "Dadabhai said the community was trying to be patient, because they understood there was a crime scene involved. \"But it's hard, because until that happens, the grieving process doesn't really begin,\" he said.\r\n",
      "For some families, patience had worn thin by Saturday, and frustration erupted as they waited to find out the status of their relatives.\r\n",
      "Ash Mohammed, 32, of Christchurch, pushed through a police barricade outside the Al Noor mosque Saturday morning, desperate for information, before police held him back.\r\n",
      "\"We just want to know if they are alive or dead,\" he could be heard telling an officer at the barricade.\r\n",
      "In an interview later, Mohammed said he was desperate for information about his brothers, Farhaj Ashashan, 30, and Ramazvora Ashashan, 31, and his father, Asif Vora, 56, who were all at the mosque on Friday.\r\n",
      "\"We just want to know, are they alive or not alive so we can start the funerals,\" he said. \"The hospital's not helping, cops not helping. Somebody has to help get the answers.\"\r\n",
      "As Amin waited and worried over the fate of his father, he was also focused on trying to protect the youngest members of his family. He and his wife have so far tried to shield their children from hearing about the attack. But on Friday, Amin's wife briefly turned on the news and an image of an ambulance popped onto the screen. Their 5-year-old son immediately dove under a table, assuming there was an earthquake. Christchurch, no stranger to disaster, suffered a devastating quake in 2011 that left 185 dead.\r\n",
      "Though his relatives back in Pakistan now fret that New Zealand is too dangerous, Amin believes Christchurch is the safest place in the world. And he hopes that his funny, fiercely loving father will pull through, so they can immerse themselves once again in the friendly hellos and the peaceful Friday prayers they have long cherished.\r\n",
      "Like Amin, Farid Ahmed refuses to turn his back on his adopted home. Ahmed lost his 45-year-old wife, Husna Ahmed, in the Al Noor mosque attack, when they split up to go to the bathroom. The gunman livestreamed the massacre on the internet, and Ahmed later saw a video of his wife being shot dead. A police officer confirmed she had passed away.\r\n",

      "Title:  534 Venezuelans find ways to cope with inflation and hunger\n",
      "Content:  534 CARACAS, Venezuela Francibel Contreras brings her three malnourished children to a soup kitchen in the dangerous hillside Caracas slum of Petare where they scoop in spoonfuls of rice and scrambled eggs in what could be their only meal of the day.\r\n",
      "Part of the tragedy of daily life in socialist Venezuela can be glimpsed in this small volunteer soup kitchen in the heart of one of Latin Americas biggest slums, which helps dozens of children as well as unemployed mothers who can no longer feed them.\r\n",
      "Some Venezuelans manage to endure the nations economic meltdown by clinging to the shrinking number of well-paid jobs or by receiving some of the hundreds of millions of dollars sent home by friends and relatives abroad a quantity that has swollen in recent years as millions of Venezuelans have fled.\r\n",
      "But a growing percentage of people across the country, especially in slums like Petare, are struggling to cope.\r\n",
      "Contrerass husband, Jorge Flores, used to have a small stand at a local market selling things like bananas and yucca, eggs and lunchmeat trying to scrape out a profit in a place where hyperinflation often made his wholesale costs double from day to day. Then he was robbed at gunpoint by a local gang. And his brother crashed the motorcycle he used to supply his stand.\r\n",
      "So Flores abandoned the market stall and looked for other work. He does some plumbing jobs and the family has turned its living room into a barbershop, sheltered beneath a corrugated metal roof held down by loose bricks and planks. Its decorated with origami-like stars that the family has made out of Venezuelas colorful but rapidly depreciating bolivar bills.\r\n",
      "Our currency is worthless, Contreras said. These days, I prefer trading a bag of flour for a manicure or a haircut.\r\n",
      "The scarcity of milk, medicine and other basics along with routine violence has eroded support for socialist President Nicolas Maduro even in poor neighborhoods like Petare that once were his strongholds. Maduro says theres an opposition-led plot to oust him from power and says U.S. economic sanctions and local opposition sabotage are responsible for the meltdown.\r\n",
      "Various local polls show he retains support from roughly a fifth of the population, many of them ideological stalwarts, government-connected insiders or poor voters dependent on government handouts, including the so-called CLAP boxes of oil, flour, rice, pasta, canned tuna and other goods that arrive several times a year.\r\n",
      "Contreras family of four gets those boxes, but its not enough to get by on for long. For months, theyve been relying on the soup kitchen launched by opposition politicians as the main source of protein for their children. On a recent day, her 7-year-old son Jorbeicker played a pickup soccer game in the hilly, dusty streets in front of her home, while her husband practiced styling his mothers hair.\r\n",
      "Im barely getting by, Flores said, scissors in hand.\r\n",
      "The four-day power outage that brought most of Venezuela to a halt this month added to Flores misery. He wasnt able to use the electric clippers needed to give customers the sort of trims they demand.\r\n",
      "It hit us in a big way, he said. You absolutely need the clippers.\r\n",
      "The couple estimates the power outage cost the family the equivalent of $11 in missed haircuts a significant sum in a country where the minimum wage amounts to $6 a month, even if most people supplement that figure by working side jobs and pooling resources with friends and neighbors.\r\n",
      "Contreras and Flores charge 2,500 bolivars about 70 U.S. cents for a trim. A government-subsidized kilogram of flour can cost almost three times that, and Contreras says that lines for the rationed goods can be endless and she sometimes comes back empty-handed. She also said she feels unsafe in the lines. Dozens of people have been killed in gang crossfires over the years, and some have been crushed to death when lines of shoppers turned into stampedes of desperate looters.\r\n",
      "Next-door neighbor Dugleidi Salcedo sent her 4-year-old daughter to live with an aunt in the city of Maracay, two hours away, because she could no longer feed her. My boys cry, the single mother of four said. But they resist more than her when I tell them that theres no food.\r\n",
      "After walking back from the soup kitchen, she opened the rusty door to her home of scraped, mint-colored walls. Inside, her 11-year-old son Daniel, who was born partially paralyzed and with developmental disabilities, lay on a stained couch while flies flew over his twisted, uncovered legs.\r\n",
      "When she took the lid off a plastic container to show her last bag of flour, a cockroach crawled out, making her jump back and scream.\r\n",
      "This is so tough, she said. I dont have a job. I dont have any money.\r\n",
      "Salcedo used to sell baked goods and juices to neighbors from the window of her kitchen. Then, her fridge broke down and she couldnt find the money to fix it.\r\n",
      "These days, she relies on the kindness of neighbors, or asks a friend who owns a small food shop for credit while she waits for loans from family members in other parts of Venezuela.\r\n",
      "This country has never been as bad, the 28-year-old said. Just buying some rice or flour is something so hard, so expensive, and often, they dont even have any.\r\n",
      "A few days later, thieves broke into the soup kitchen and stole food. Then, a fire broke out in the slum, burning 17 homes to the ground. It was caused by candles that were apparently being used for light after a power outage an almost everyday occurrence in many parts of Venezuela. Opposition lawmaker Manuela Bolivar, whose Nodriza Project runs the soup kitchen, said that when firefighters arrived, they lacked water and had to put out the blaze with dirt.\r\n",

      "Content:  535 BOUCAN FERDINAND, Haiti (Reuters) - Near the bottom of the island of Hispaniola in southeast Haiti is a forgotten village, cut off from its own country, and slowly emptying as its residents leave for the neighboring Dominican Republic. \r\n",
      "Without health services, electricity, or paved roads, Boucan Ferdinand lost its only road to the nearest Haitian town, Bois Negresse, in devastating floods back in 2004. \r\n",
      "Some of its residents have left for the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince and others cling on to a precarious life. Many have crossed illegally into the more prosperous Dominican Republic. \r\n",
      "“They do not have access to basic social services, this situation is at the root of the mass migration to the Dominican Republic,” said Jean Gilles Viola, mayor of the municipality that governs Boucan Ferdinand and around 20 other villages. \r\n",
      "Those who remain live in thatch and stick hovels, collecting rainwater to drink and at constant risk of infectious diseases. \r\n",
      "Some children, in impeccable blue uniforms, walk to a school in the town of Chapotin - a trip that takes an hour and a half over a narrow path, impassable in the rainy season. \r\n",
      "In the village are two makeshift classrooms, run by the Baptist and Catholic chapels. \r\n",
      "“This year my children will not go to school,” said village farmer Wilber Jean in October, as his children played nearby. \r\n",
      "“Here you pay a ton. There,” pointing across the border, “the president pays.” \r\n",
      "Children collect firewood or graze small flocks of goats and sheep to help their parents. During planting time, many skip school in order to help on the farms, earning less than $2 a day. \r\n",
      "In the mornings, the village smells of burning firewood brought by the children as the women make breakfast: sometimes there is pasta, but more likely coffee and a piece of bread. Often there is rice and beans. Meat, a luxury. \r\n",
      "Haiti, which according to the World Bank is the poorest country in the Americas, has not recovered from a powerful earthquake that hit it on Jan. 12 2010, leaving more than 200,000 dead. \r\n",
      "The countryside has been emptying out. Less than half of Haitians live in rural communities compared to 84 percent in 1960, World Bank data shows. \r\n",
      "Boucan Ferdinand seems to have fallen off the map. Radios mainly capture Dominican signals. \r\n",
      "“I’m tired of looking for stations in Haiti,” complained Polo, a 64-year-old man who returned here with his wife and one of his grandchildren after spending more than 40 years in the Dominican Republic. \r\n",

      "Content:  536 SHANGHAI (Reuters) - An explosion at a pesticide plant in eastern China has killed 47 people and injured more than 600, state media said on Friday, the latest casualties in a series of industrial accidents that has angered the public. \r\n",
      "The blast occurred on Thursday at the Chenjiagang Industrial Park in the city of Yancheng, in Jiangsu province, and the fire was finally brought under control at 3.00 a.m. on Friday (1900 GMT), state television said. \r\n",
      "Survivors were taken to 16 hospitals with 640 people being treated for injuries. Thirty-two of them were critically injured, it said. \r\n",
      "The fire at a plant owned by the Tianjiayi Chemical Company spread to neighboring factories. Children at a kindergarten in the vicinity were also injured in the blast, media reported. \r\n",
      "The cause of the explosion was under investigation, but the company - which produces more than 30 organic chemical compounds, some of which are highly flammable - has been cited and fined for work safety violations in the past, the China Daily said. \r\n",
      "President Xi Jinping, who is in Italy on a state visit, ordered all-out efforts to care for the injured and to “earnestly maintain social stability”, state television said. \r\n",
      "Authorities must step up action to prevent such incidents from happening and find out the cause of the blast as quickly as possible, Xi added. \r\n",
      "“There have recently been a series of major accidents, and all places and relevant departments must fully learn the lessons from these,” the report cited Xi as saying. \r\n",
      "The Jiangsu environmental protection bureau said in a late Thursday statement the environmental monitoring station in the area had found no abnormal concentrations of toluene, xylene or benzene. \r\n",
      "Concentrations of acetone and chloroform outside the perimeter of the explosion zone were also within normal limits, it added. \r\n",
      "Jiangsu will launch inspections on chemical producers and warehouses, according to an emergency notice published by official media on Friday. \r\n",
      "The notice, published on the news website of Jiangsu province’s Communist Party, said the government would shut down any chemical firms found not complying with regulations on dangerous chemicals. \r\n",
      "Public anger over safety standards has grown in China over industrial accidents ranging from mining disasters to factory fires that have marred three decades of swift economic growth. \r\n",
      "In 2015, 165 people were killed in a series of explosions at a chemical warehouse in the northern city of Tianjin. \r\n",
      "The explosions at Tianjin, one of the world’s busiest ports and not far from the capital, Beijing, were big enough to be seen by satellites and register on earthquake sensors. \r\n",
      "Despite repeated pledges by the government to tighten safety, chemical plants in particular have been plagued by disasters. \r\n",
      "In November, a series of blasts during the delivery of a flammable gas at a chemical manufacturer killed 23 people. \r\n",

      "Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will join an estimated 5,000 people standing quietly at Hagley Park in front of the Al Noor mosque, where most of the victims died. \r\n",
      "The Muslim call to prayer at 1.30 p.m. (0030 GMT) will be broadcast nationally, followed by two minutes of silence. \r\n",
      "Ardern, who swiftly denounced the attack as terrorism, announced a ban on military-style semi-automatic and assault rifles under tough new gun laws on Thursday. \r\n",
      "Most victims of New Zealand’s worst mass shooting were migrants or refugees from countries such as Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Turkey, Somalia, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. \r\n",
      "The #headscarfforharmony movement, launched by an Auckland doctor, encouraged people to wear headscarves on Friday to show their support for the Muslim community. \r\n",
      "Robyn Molony, 65, was with a group of friend wearing headscarves at Hagley Park, where they walked daily. \r\n",
      "“We are wearing headscarves showing our support, love and solidarity, and hope that by everybody doing this it will demonstrate to Muslim women ... that they are one with us,” she said. \r\n",

      "“It’s good that people acknowledge what has happened here,” said Mark Rangi, 59, who was praying in Al Noor mosque last Friday when the shooter walked in. \r\n",
      "Rangi, who came to the service on crutches, said he was hit in the leg with bullet fragments and won’t pray because he can’t get down with his stitches. \r\n",
      "“It’s good that the whole Christchurch community has come down and says this isn’t right.” \r\n",
      "Authorities have estimated more than 2,000 people will likely attend the prayers and the burials during the day. \r\n",
      "“We’re not moving on. This grieving is going to take a long time,” said 52-year-old Christchurch resident Bell Sibly, who wore a headscarf to show her support. “But what he’s done, he was hoping to divide us, and instead, he’s brought us all together in one big hug.” \r\n",
      "Residents of Christchurch are still recovering from a devastating earthquake that hit in 2011, killing 185 and injured thousands. \r\n",
      "“Since the earthquakes, we’ve gone through a lot as a city and we’re a lot more caring and looking out for one another,” said James Sheehan, 62. \r\n",

      "Content:  538 CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand The leafy New Zealand city where a self-proclaimed racist fatally shot 50 people at mosques during Friday prayers is known for its picturesque meandering river and English heritage. For decades, Christchurch has also been the center of the countrys small but persistent white supremacist movement.\r\n",
      "An expert on such fringe groups says its probably more than coincidence that the accused mosque shooter, 28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant, settled in the region, known for a whiter demographic than the countrys north, after frequently traveling abroad in 2016-2018 in what appears to have been an extreme-right pilgrimage.\r\n",
      "He went mostly to areas of Europe with a long history of sectarian dispute, including clashes between Renaissance Europe and the Ottoman Empire and the breakup of Yugoslavia following its ethnic and religious conflicts.\r\n",
      "The attack has upended New Zealands image as one of the worlds safest and most tolerant countries. It also has highlighted apparent failings by security and intelligence services to view white supremacists as a real threat or to take seriously warnings from Muslim groups of a rise in Islamophobic and xenophobic incidents in recent years.\r\n",
      "Tarrant planned his attack on two mosques meticulously and had resolved two years earlier to kill Muslims, according to a manifesto he published moments before the massacre. He actively planned the Christchurch shootings for the past three months, he said in the manifesto posted online and emailed to the office of New Zealands prime minister minutes before driving to his first target, the golden-domed Al Noor mosque.\r\n",
      "Police say they are certain Tarrant was the only gunman but may have had support and are investigating that possibility. He had five guns, two of which were converted into semi-automatic weapons. Its likely that at least some were legally purchased online from a Christchurch gun store.\r\n",
      "Possible links between the shooter and white supremacists in New Zealands south have been alleged by recreational gun user and hunting guide Pete Breidahl.\r\n",
      "In a video posted on Facebook on Saturday, he said he complained in late 2017 to an arms officer a local police officer who monitors peoples gun licenses about the disturbing behavior of members of a rifle club in the southern city of Dunedin that Tarrant reportedly joined.\r\n",
      "In the video and comments posted online, Breidahl said the club members had Confederate flags, wore camouflage clothing with rank insignia, vilified Muslims and had homicidal fantasies. He claimed to have met Tarrant, calling him not right. Police said they have no record of a complaint but are looking into Breidahls claims further.\r\n",
      "Academic Paul Spoonley, who has extensively researched white supremacist groups in New Zealand, said they have been relatively quiet in Christchurch since a 2011 earthquake that forced whole neighborhoods to move and altered the citys demographics with an influx of migrant workers for reconstruction.\r\n",
      "Theyve been quieter recently but they havent gone away. They are still here, he said, citing a 2016 incident in which pigs heads were left at the Al Noor mosque, where 42 people died in Fridays massacre.\r\n",
      "A business owner in Christchurch has also attracted media attention since the massacre because his companys vans were emblazoned with neo-Nazi references including the black sun symbol that Tarrants guns were covered with. The same images, which are used as the companys branding, appear on its website.\r\n",
      "When AP visited the registered business address, located in one of Christchurchs poorer neighborhoods, three of its vans were parked opposite, their black sun imagery removed but still identifiable by a company website address on them. A visibly hostile man standing beside the vans, who did not appear to be the business owner, did not want to answer questions.\r\n",
      "Police on Tuesday said they had arrested a 44-year-old man in Christchurch for distributing objectionable material and he would appear in court the next day.\r\n",
      "According to Spoonley, the level of hate crimes in New Zealand is low compared with other countries as is the number of white supremacists, but its always a challenge to get people to accept that they exist.\r\n",
      "Theres a reluctance to see equivalence between the risks presented by right-wing extremist groups and radical Islamic and leftist groups, he said.\r\n",
      "Neighboring Australias white supremacist scene is more virulent, in part reflecting the history of its White Australia immigration policy which existed in various forms from soon after Federation in 1901 to as late as 1973. In modern times, the rise of a succession of prominent right-wing politicians starting with Pauline Hanson and her One Nation Party in the mid-1990s also legitimized such views.\r\n",
      "Spoonley estimates there are 200-250 hardcore white supremacists in New Zealand and about 300-400 people on the edges.\r\n",
      "I would be very surprised if Tarrant didnt make some sort of contact, he said.\r\n",
      "The groups, which emerged in the late 1960s, have evolved over time, coalescing for years around fear of New Zealand moving too far from its British roots, anti-Semitism and opposition to Maori sovereignty and Asian immigrants, and then shifting to Islamophobia following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S.\r\n",
      "Spoonley, who researched extreme-right groups in the U.K. in the 1970s, said when he returned to New Zealand in the 1980s he was told by authorities there were no similar organizations.\r\n",
      "But he quickly found more than 70 extreme-right groups, many of them in Christchurch. He attributes three murders in New Zealand since 1989 to white supremacists, including two that were ideologically motivated a South Korean tourist in 2003 and a homeless gay man in 1999.\r\n",
      "As Tarrant plotted more recently, Muslim groups in New Zealand were growing increasingly concerned by a rise in abuse against the community but say they were ignored.\r\n",
      "There has been an increasing trend which has been brought to the attention of the authorities several times in the last three to four years, including police, said Anwar Ghani, a spokesman for a federation of Islamic organizations. It was treated not so seriously.\r\n",
      "Verbal abuse, hate emails, hate phone calls and assaults that seem to have an Islamophobic and racist motivation, or a combination of the two, are among the hate crimes experienced by Muslims in New Zealand, he said.\r\n",
      "The country does not have an official hate crimes database, making it difficult to measure the trend, but some incidents have been widely reported, causing outrage but sparking no real official measures.\r\n",
      "Ghani said there are dotted lines between Fridays massacre, hostility to Muslims among a segment of the New Zealand population and the global rise of extreme right-wing movements.\r\n",
      "If the issue is not addressed in a proper manner then the problem will continue to increase, he said. They are getting bolder and bolder.\r\n",
      "Paul Buchanan, a former policy analyst and intelligence consultant for U.S. government security agencies, said the failure of intelligence agencies to detect Tarrant reflects politically based decisions to concentrate resources on monitoring the small number of Islamic extremists in New Zealand.\r\n",
      "My interpretation is that in the past 20 years and since 9/11 a political decision was made to prioritize detection and prevention of homegrown jihadists, he said.\r\n",
      "They decided to go whole hog, 80-85 percent of resources into detecting jihadists, he said. The rest was devoted to Marxists, environmentalists, animal rights activists. They went for the left.\r\n",
      "One such jihadi from New Zealand, along with an Australian, was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in November 2013 while fighting for al-Qaida.\r\n",

      "Two other armed suspects were taken into custody while police tried to determine what role, if any, they played in the cold-blooded attack that stunned New Zealand, a country so peaceful that police officers rarely carry guns.\r\n",
      "It was by far the deadliest shooting in modern New Zealand history.\r\n",
      "It is clear that this can now only be described as a terrorist attack, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said, noting that many of the victims could be migrants or refugees.\r\n",
      "She pronounced it one of New Zealands darkest days.\r\n",
      "Tarrant, who police say carried out at least one of the shootings, posted a jumbled, 74-page manifesto on social media in which he identified himself by name and said he was a 28-year-old Australian and white supremacist who was out to avenge attacks in Europe perpetrated by Muslims.\r\n",
      "The gunman also livestreamed in graphic detail 17 minutes of his rampage at Al Noor Mosque, where, armed with at least two assault rifles and a shotgun, he sprayed worshippers with bullets over and over, killing at least 41 people. Several more people were killed in an attack on a second mosque in the city a short time later.\r\n",
      "At least 48 people were wounded, some critically. Police also defused explosive devices in a car.\r\n",
      "Police did not say whether the same person was responsible for both shootings. They gave no details about those taken into custody except to say that none had been on any watch list.\r\n",
      "Tarrants relatives in the Australian town of Grafton, in New South Wales, contacted police after learning of the shooting and were helping with the investigation, local authorities said. Tarrant has spent little time in Australia in the past four years and only had minor traffic infractions on his record.\r\n",
      "On Saturday, outside one of the two mosques, 32-year-old Ash Mohammed pushed through police barricades in hopes of finding out what happened to his father and two brothers, whose cellphones rang unanswered. An officer stopped him.\r\n",
      "We just want to know if they are dead or alive, Mohammed told the officer.\r\n",
      "In the aftermath, the countrys threat level was raised from low to high, police warned Muslims against going to a mosque anywhere in New Zealand, and the national airline canceled several flights in and out of Christchurch, a city of nearly 400,000.\r\n",
      "World leaders condemned the violence and offered condolences, with President Donald Trump tweeting, We stand in solidarity with New Zealand. Pakistans Prime Minister Imran Khan and other Islamic leaders pointed to the bloodbath and other such attacks as evidence of rising hostility toward Muslims since 9/11.\r\n",
      "New Zealand, with a population of 5 million, has relatively loose gun laws and an estimated 1.5 million firearms, or roughly one for every three people. But it has one of the lowest gun homicide rates in the world. In 2015, it had just eight gun homicides.\r\n",
      "Before Fridays attack, New Zealands deadliest shooting in modern history took place in 1990 in the small town of Aramoana, where a gunman killed 13 people following a dispute with a neighbor.\r\n",
      "On Saturday, the prime minister said the primary perpetrator in the shootings was a licensed gun owner and legally acquired the five guns used. Ardern said the countrys gun laws will change as a result of the carnage, but she did not specify how.\r\n",
      "New Zealand is also generally considered to be welcoming to migrants and refugees. On Saturday, people across the country were reaching out to Muslims in their communities on social media to volunteer acts of kindness offering rides to the grocery store or volunteering to walk with them if they felt unsafe. In other forums, people discussed Muslim food restrictions as they prepared to drop off meals for those affected.\r\n",
      "The prime minister said the attack reflected extremist views that have absolutely no place in New Zealand.\r\n",
      "Immigrants have chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home, Ardern said. They are us.\r\n",
      "At the White House, Trump called the bloodshed a terrible thing but rejected any suggestion the white nationalist movement is a rising threat around the world, saying it is a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.\r\n",
      "Tarrant, in his rambling manifesto, deemed Trump a symbol of renewed white identity.\r\n",
      "At the Al Noor mosque, witness Len Peneha said he saw a man dressed in black and wearing a helmet with some kind of device on top enter the house of worship and then heard dozens of shots, followed by people running out in terror.\r\n",
      "Peneha, who lives next door, said the gunman ran out of the mosque, dropped what appeared to be a semi-automatic weapon in his driveway and fled. Peneha then went into the mosque to help the victims.\r\n",
      "I saw dead people everywhere. There were three in the hallway, at the door leading into the mosque, and people inside the mosque, he said. I dont understand how anyone could do this to these people, to anyone. Its ridiculous.\r\n",
      "Facebook, Twitter and Google scrambled to take down the gunmans video, which was widely available on social media for hours after the bloodbath.\r\n",
      "In the video, the killer spends more than two minutes inside the mosque spraying terrified worshippers with gunfire. He then walks outside, where he shoots at people on the sidewalk. Childrens screams can be heard in the distance as he returns to his car to get another rifle. He walks back into the mosque, where there are at least two dozen people lying on the ground.\r\n",
      "After going back outside and shooting a woman there, he gets back in his car, where a song can be heard blasting. The singer bellows, I am the god of hellfire! and the gunman drives off before police even arrive.\r\n",
      "The second attack took place at the Linwood mosque about 5 kilometers (3 miles) away. Mark Nichols told the New Zealand Herald that he heard about five gunshots and that a worshipper returned fire with a rifle or shotgun.\r\n",
      "The footage showed the killer was carrying a shotgun and two fully automatic military assault rifles, with an extra magazine taped to one of the weapons so that he could reload quickly. He also had more assault weapons in the trunk of his car, along with what appeared to be explosives.\r\n",
      "His manifesto was a welter of often politically contradictory views, touching on many of the most combustible issues of the day, among them the Second Amendment right to own guns, Muslim immigration, terrorist attacks and the wealthiest 1 percent.\r\n",
      "He portrayed himself as a racist and a fascist and raged against non-Westerners, but said China is the nation that most aligns with his political and social values.\r\n",
      "The gunman said he was not a member of any organization, acted alone and chose New Zealand to show that even the most remote parts of the world are not free of mass immigration.\r\n",
      "Last year, New Zealands prime minister announced that the country would boost its annual refugee quota from 1,000 to 1,500 in 2020. Ardern, whose party campaigned on a promise to take in more refugees, called it the right thing to do.\r\n",
      "Christchurch, sometimes called the Garden City, has been rebuilding since an earthquake in 2011 killed 185 people and destroyed many downtown buildings.\r\n",

      "Title:  541 The Daily 202: ‘The last election was a wake-up call.’ Why GOP leaders are turning on Steve King.\n",
      "Content:  541 THE BIG IDEA: The top three Republicans in House leadership each rebuked Rep. Steve King on Thursday after the Iowa Republican wondered aloud how the terms white nationalist and white supremacist became offensive during an interview with the New York Times.\r\n",
      "Steves language is reckless, wrong and has no place in our society, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said. Everything about white supremacy and white nationalism goes against who we are as a nation.\r\n",
      "House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said it was offensive to try to legitimize those terms. He credited King for issuing a statement after the story published that said, I reject those labels and the evil ideology that they define.\r\n",
      "Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who just became No. 3 in GOP leadership by winning the race for conference chair, tweeted: These comments are abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse.\r\n",
      "Both McCarthy and Scalise were silent in October when asked for comment on incendiary remarks King had made then, Felicia Sonmez notes. At the time, Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), then the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, was the only member of House GOP leadership to rebuke King.\r\n",
      "--Mr. King, in the interview, said he was not a racist, Trip Gabriel reports in the Times. He pointed to his Twitter timeline showing him greeting Iowans of all races and religions in his Washington office. (The same office once displayed a Confederate flag on his desk.) At the same time, he said, he supports immigrants who enter the country legally and fully assimilate because what matters more than race is the culture of America based on values brought to the United States by whites from Europe. White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization how did that language become offensive? Mr. King said. Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization? \r\n",
      "Last week, as the new Congress was sworn in, Mr. King sat on his side of a chamber sharply delineated by demographics, the story concludes. The Democratic majority included record numbers of African-Americans and women, including the first Native American and the first Muslim women. Mr. Kings side was mostly people who look like him. You could look over there and think the Democratic Party is no country for white men, he said.\r\n",
      "Donald Trump Jr. goes pheasant hunting with Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) near Akron, Iowa, in October 2017. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters)\r\n",
      "-- King is not some random backbencher. In the most recent Congress, he chaired the House Judiciary Committees prestigious Constitution subcommittee. More than that, though, the Times story lays out Kings influence on President Trump and his role in bringing the debate over a border wall into the mainstream.\r\n",
      "Mr. Trumps preoccupation with the wall and anti-immigrant politics reflects how he has embraced the once-fringe views of Mr. King, Trip writes. Mr. King may have been ostracized by some Republicans over his racist remarks and extremist ties, but as much of the nation debates immigration, his views now carry substantial influence on the right. Early in Mr. Trumps term, the president invited Mr. King to the Oval Office. There, the president boasted of having raised more money for the congressmans campaigns than anyone else, including during a 2014 Iowa visit, Mr. King recalled in an interview with The Times. Yes, Mr. President, Mr. King replied. But I market-tested your immigration policy for 14 years, and that ought to be worth something.\r\n",
      "-- Indeed, King has a long history of making inflammatory comments related to immigration that predates the Trump era. In the fall, he voiced support for Faith Goldy, an unsuccessful Toronto mayoral candidate who has promoted the baseless notion that a white genocide is underway, Isaac Stanley-Becker notes. Shortly thereafter, reports surfaced that King had met in August with members of an Austrian political party founded by former Nazis, during a trip funded by a group that promotes awareness of the Holocaust.\r\n",
      "Hes routinely questioned the value of nonwhite diversity. Id ask you to go back through history and figure out, where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that youre talking about, he told Esquire in 2016. Where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?\r\n",
      "In 2013, he told Newsmax that for every immigrant in the country illegally who becomes valedictorian, there are another 100 out there that they weigh 130 pounds, and theyve got calves the size of cantaloupes because theyre hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\r\n",
      "The Weekly Standard reported in November that King jokingly referred to Mexican immigrants as dirt while bantering with supporters before a campaign event. When King denied it, the conservative magazine released audio that backed up its reporting. When the publication was shuttered a few weeks later for reasons that had nothing to do with the piece, King celebrated its demise.\r\n",
      "-- During a Daily 202 Live interview last June, Scalise ripped Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) for her incendiary comments about confronting Trumps aides but demurred when I pressed him about King retweeting a self-professed Nazi sympathizer and then refusing to delete it. I havent seen the tweet, Scalise said, despite it being in the news for several days. I have not seen the tweet, and you know, maybe well go take a look at it and talk to Steve and see whats going on there.\r\n",
      "As the conversation moved to other issues, Scalise circled back to say that its important to condemn Nazi sympathizers but stopped short of chastising King. We need to be very vocal about condemning that kind of viewpoint, because there are still people out there that try to go under the false impression that the Holocaust didnt exist, he said. I mean people say that, and its wrong.\r\n",
      "-- In addition to the substance of Kings comments, there are eight other factors that might explain why Republican leaders are more willing to publicly break with him than they have been in the past:\r\n",
      "1. The midterms showed King could be defeated. He won his ninth term in November by only three percentage points, even though Trump had carried the district by 27 points in 2016. That was without national Democrats investing any resources to support Democrat J.D. Scholten, a former independent-league baseball player.\r\n",
      "During the run-up to the midterms, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) declined to remove King as the co-chair of her campaign for a full term. I can't be held responsible for everyone's comments, she told reporters, adding that she strongly disagreed with the comments that hes made.\r\n",
      "This week, Reynolds announced that she will not endorse King in 2020. The last election was a wake-up call for it to be that close,\" she told the Des Moines NBC affiliate WHO on Wednesday. That indicates that it does open the door for other individuals to take a look at that. I will stay out of the primary. I'm not going to weigh in.\r\n",
      "2. King now faces a credible primary challenger, which he has not in the past. On Wednesday, Iowa state Sen. Randy Feenstra (R) an assistant majority leader and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee announced that he will take on King for the GOP nomination. Feenstra argued that he can be more effective at advancing the Trump agenda. Today, Iowas 4th District doesnt have a voice in Washington, because our current representatives caustic nature has left us without a seat at the table, he said in a  statement. We dont need any more sideshows or distractions.\r\n",
      "Last night, Feenstra sought to raise money off Kings latest comments, which he described as another embarrassment:\r\n",
      "Another day, another embarrassment. This behavior hurts our district and our conservative cause. We need an effective conservative. Congressman King isn't. Chip in to #RetireSteveKing here: https://t.co/tTXNxX19ph\r\n",
      " Randy Feenstra (@RandyFeenstra) January 10, 2019\r\n",
      "Kings son, who manages his campaigns, responded to Feenstras announcement by highlighting Trumps previous endorsement of King as the worlds most conservative human being.\r\n",
      "A second Republican, Army veteran Bret Richards, also announced that he will run this week. Im hearing there may be at least one more GOP challenger who hasnt yet announced as well, said Kathie Obradovich, the opinion editor at the Des Moines Register.\r\n",
      "3. Forcefully condemning King now could dissuade him from seeking a 10th term. Strategists in both parties agree that the odds of the GOP holding the northwest Iowa seat go up dramatically if he doesnt run again.\r\n",
      "Notably, the new chairman of the NRCC, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), declined to say Thursday whether the party will back the incumbent in 2020. It's too early to think about campaigns, I mean that's two years away, Emmer told the Hill, arguing that the committee does not typically play in primaries. Regarding the Times story, the chairman said: I disagree with the statements as they've been characterized, as I understand them, and it's not helpful.\r\n",
      "4. Iowa will be a battleground again in 2020 for president, Senate and House and King could be a drag on the rest of the GOP ticket.\r\n",
      "Democrats picked up two of Iowas four House seats in November, and Republicans promise to target both of them again next year. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) is also seeking a second term, and she is considered one of the three or four most vulnerable GOP incumbents in the country. Ernsts press office did not respond to my request for comment yesterday on whether she still backs King after his comments to the Times.\r\n",
      "Veteran Iowa political journalist David Yepsen thinks Scholtens chances of being able to beat Ernst in the Senate race are higher than beating anyone but King in the Fourth District. Arguably less of a long shot, he posted on Twitter. Interestingly, Scholten retweeted that.\r\n",
      "5. Republican presidential aspirants have been reluctant to cross King in the past because he commands a loyal following among the devoted grass-roots activists who attend low-turnout caucuses in outsize numbers, but theres no nominating fight to worry about in 2020. At least right now.\r\n",
      "6. Because they now control the majority, House Democrats can force Republicans to take a position on King. Several Democrats, led by Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), are calling on leadership to quickly take up a resolution that would formally censure King for his comments. It could pass with a simple majority. It would force every Republican to take an on-the-record position about their colleague. Ryans staff is drafting a censure resolution for him to introduce.\r\n",
      "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) voiced interest in the effort, per Politico.\r\n",
      "Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), who was born in Iowa and has been testing the waters for a potential long-shot bid to win the Democratic presidential nomination, also seized on the issue.\r\n",
      "Some rank-and-file Republicans appear open to a vote for censure. Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.), for example, blasted Kings comments to the Times. The embrace of these terms and philosophies are fundamentally wrong and offensive and have no place in Congress, our nation, or anywhere, he tweeted.\r\n",
      "Another Michigan Republican, Rep. Justin Amash, added: This is an embrace of racism, and it has no place in Congress or anywhere.\r\n",
      "Suggesting that he recognizes the underlying political dynamics have shifted, King sounded less defiant and combative yesterday than he has during previous firestorms. In addition to a news release, he gave a sit-down interview to NBC News. I reject white nationalism. I reject white supremacy. It's not part of any of my ideology, he said in his Capitol Hill office. I reject anyone who carries that ideology.\r\n",
      "7. The donor community and the business world have turned on King. Corporate America, which has long been more supportive of immigration than other elements of the GOP coalition, has become more activist in the Trump era under pressure from employees and customers. During the home stretch before the midterms, several corporate PACs pulled support for King. Among them: the chipmaker Intel, pet-food-maker Purina, the dairy Land OLakes and the ham producers at Smithfield.\r\n",
      "8. Conservative thought leaders are ready to write King out of the movement. The model is William F. Buckleys legendary crusade against Robert Welch and the John Birch Society in the pages of National Review. Rich Lowry, now the editor of NR, called Kings comments yesterday simply contemptible.\r\n",
      "Stephen Hayes, who as editor in chief of the Weekly Standard made the call to publish the audio of King joking about immigrants as dirt, said yesterday: What sane, thoughtful conservative would choose to remain in a party home to such an unapologetic bigot?\r\n",

The deep desire to paint Republicans as racists rather than defenders of Western cultural superiority leads the media to lie, he wrote.

      "SHUTDOWN LATEST:\r\n",
      "-- The White House continues laying the groundwork to declare a national emergency to get money for the border wall, possibly by tapping disaster relief funds. Erica Werner, Josh Dawsey, Mike DeBonis and Seung Min Kim report: The administration is eyeing unused money in the Army Corps of Engineers budget, specifically a disaster spending bill passed by Congress last year that includes $13.9 billion allocated but not spent for civil works projects, two people with knowledge of the developments said Thursday. Trump has urged the Army Corps to determine how fast contracts could be signed and whether construction could begin within 45 days, according to one of the people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the preparations. The list includes dozens of flood control projects in areas affected by recent natural disasters, including the Texas coastline inundated by Hurricane Harvey and parts of Puerto Rico battered by Hurricane Maria. The military construction budget is also being looked at as a potential source for unspent funds, with billions more potentially available there.\r\n",
      "Some 800,000 federal workers are about to miss their first paychecks since the shutdown began Dec. 22, and problems plaguing shuttered national parks, food inspection processes and other federal services are multiplying. The Senate unanimously passed legislation Thursday that would guarantee back pay to furloughed federal workers once the shutdown ends, although thousands of government contractors who have been furloughed may never recoup their losses. [Trump] reiterated Thursday that he may declare a national emergency if Democrats dont give him what he wants. Now if we dont make a deal with Congress, most likely I will do that, Trump said to Fox News host Sean Hannity about an emergency declaration in an interview that aired Thursday night. ... At the same time, House Democrats pressed forward with their strategy of passing individual spending bills to reopen portions of the federal government that have been closed in the shutdown.\r\n",
      "But some Democrats, while publicly vowing to fight an emergency declaration through the courts, see a silver lining to the potential move: One Democratic aide called an emergency declaration an elegant way out of this mess one that would allow Trump and Republicans to declare to their most fervent supporters that they had taken Democrats to the brink, while Democrats would quickly move to tie up any construction in the courts. The House and Senate could move quickly to pass a bill to reopen the government, predicated on assurances from Trump that he would sign the legislation. Many Democrats also say that an emergency declaration would benefit them politically by unifying their party while splitting Republicans, creating unease among some conservatives who have expressed discomfort with a president sidestepping Congress in a way they might see as similar to how President Barack Obama circumvented Congress on immigration.\r\n",
      "A separate effort among a group of Republican senators to craft a compromise that could reopen the government ended in failure: These deal-minded Senate Republicans had shuttled Thursday morning between meetings with [Mitch McConnell] and Vice President Pence, batting around a proposal that would include Trumps desired $5.7 billion in wall funding, and a renewable, three-year status for certain immigrants brought illegally to the country as children, along with other provisions. But by midafternoon Thursday, Pence poured cold water on the idea, telling reporters at the Capitol that Trump wanted to wait on trying to make a deal for dreamers until the Supreme Court had ruled on [DACA].

Instead, Mr. Kushner argued an emergency should be invoked only if it creates a clear path for the White House to build the wall, the key issue in the standoff between Mr. Trump and congressional Democrats that has led to the shutdown. Lets stop doing things just to do them, Mr. Kushner said, according to officials familiar with the meeting.\r\n",

      "-- Trump's team is also seeking to resume more stalled federal services, sparking increasing complaints of executive overreach. Damian Paletta reports: The message, conveyed during a conference call between top officials at the White House Office of Management and Budget and federal agencies, is part of a broader effort to keep large parts of the federal government running while [Trump] digs in for a lengthy battle over a border wall. The rapid and in many cases unprecedented scope of OMBs directives has prompted criticism from Democrats and some Republicans that the White House is bending the rules to contain political fallout. Keeping basic functions of government intact during the shutdown has also taken the administration into uncharted legal territory, reversing precedents as it searches for ways to fund efforts for which Congress has not appropriated any money.\r\n",
      "-- Construction of the wall could trigger more legal fights over the government attempting to seize private property through eminent domain. Katie Zezima and Mark Berman report: Previous eminent domain attempts along the Texas border have led to more than a decade of court battles, some of which date to George W. Bushs administration and have yet to be resolved. Many landowners are vowing to fight anew. The Texas Civil Rights Project is now trying to let people know that they are not required to sign over access to their land. They are going door-to-door in some neighborhoods, letting people know their rights, and they are running digital ads and spots on local radio stations.\r\n",
      "-- Visiting the border, Trump dubiously insisted that Mexico would still eventually pay for his wall.Philip Rucker and Felicia Sonmez report: At a U.S. Border Patrol station, where he attended a roundtable on immigration and border security, Trump ... maintained [it] would eventually be paid for by Mexico many, many times over through a new trade deal that has yet to be ratified by Congress. I didnt mean, Please write me a check, Trump said of his oft-made claim that Mexico would pay for the wall. During the 2016 campaign, Trumps campaign sent The Washington Post a memo detailing its plan for Mexico to make a one-time payment of $5-10 billion to pay for the border wall. Even if approved by Congress, the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal would not necessarily contribute more money to federal coffers, as countries do not lose money on trade deficits.\r\n",
      "-- The episode illustrates how [Trumps] routine application of falsehoods, exaggerations and lies in service of political combat has come back to burn him, David Nakamura explains. He did say [Mexico would directly pay for the wall]  at least 212 times during his campaign and dozens more since he took office. And now during the shutdown, the White House is searching far and wide for potential pots of money it can tap The story keeps changing by the day like everything, said Cecilia Muñoz, a vice president at New America, a liberal think tank, who served as a White House domestic policy adviser under [Obama]. Of Trumps original plan for funding the wall, she added: They had no earthly idea how they would get Mexico to do that, so they came up with an idea to try to pass the laugh test, which they didnt do.\r\n",
      "-- When [Trump] headed to one of the busiest areas along the Texas-Mexico border Thursday morning, he was dressed for a natural disaster, fashion critic Robin Givhan writes. He was scheduled for a roundtable discussion about immigration and border security in McAllen, Tex., and a security briefing at the Rio Grande. Yet there was no wildfire, earthquake or rogue hurricane bearing down on either of these places. Frankly, the weather reports looked fairly pleasant. The ground was not shifting. But no matter. The point was not whether there was scorched rubble to navigate or water-soaked sofas and mattresses around which to maneuver. The clothes were a symbolic flourish to underscore the message: The border itself is the disaster.\r\n",
      "THE HUMAN TOLL:\r\n",
      "-- Some government employees have started selling household items online to help make ends meet. Taylor Telford reports: A federal worker in Morgantown, W.Va., took to Facebook this week to sell welding tools, left behind by his deceased father-in-law. Another, a die-hard Star Wars fan in Woodbridge, Va., did the same with a life-size replica of Kylo Rens lightsaber. A single father in Indiana hosted a sale on eBay with five pages of things found around the house, including Bibles, Nintendo bedsheets and Dr. Seuss neckties. Sells for $93.88 at Walmart. Asking $10, a government worker wrote on a Craigslist ad for a Lulu Ladybug rocking chair. We need money to pay bills.\r\n",
      "-- The FBI Agents Association warned that todays missed paycheck could affect security clearances of their members. Devlin Barrett, Tom Jackman and Nick Miroff report: In a letter to the White House and lawmakers, FBIAA leaders wrote that their agents are subject to high security standards that include rigorous and routine financial background checks. ... Missing payments on debts could create delays in securing or renewing security clearances, and could even disqualify agents from continuing to serve in some cases. [FBIAA President Thomas] OConnor said FBI investigations already are being affected. No one at the FBI is getting paid, but investigators are still working while much of their support staffs, including some surveillance experts, are not, OConnor said.\r\n",
      "An Earnings and Leave Statement pay stub that air traffic controllers saw online Thursday for the first time shows $0 in net pay. (Obtained by The Washington Post)\r\n",
      "-- Air traffic controllers get their first shutdown pay stub: $0.00, by Mike Laris: Before Corey Soignet had hundreds of lives in his hands, hour after hour, in the airspace above Houstons George Bush Intercontinental Airport, he spent years guiding military aircraft. He had joined the Air National Guard with an eye toward becoming a pilot, but found being an air traffic controller such meaningful work that he made it his career. Hes learned the hyper focus needed to help guide aircraft through night skies and brutal storms. On Thursday, Soignet with 22 years of experience working for the military and Federal Aviation Administration got a look at his wages for the last two weeks of work helping keep U.S. skies and travelers safe. His net pay? $0.00. Soignet knew it was coming, but it was jarring nonetheless. Now I dont know how much I can put toward that credit card, he said. Do I pay half my water bill? Do I have enough money for 30 days or 60 days or six months? You cant ask people to budget like that. More than 24,000 FAA employees are working without pay, since their positions are considered vital for life and safety.\r\n",
      "-- Many farmers, who have largely stood by Trump as he launched his trade war, are starting to reconsider their support. The New York Timess Jack Healy and Tyler Pager report: While many rural conservatives may loathe the idea of Big Government, farmers and the federal government are welded together by dozens of programs and billions of dollars in spending. Now, farmers and farm groups say that federal crop payments have stopped flowing. Farmers cannot get federally backed operating loans to buy seed for their spring planting, or feed for their livestock. They cannot look up new government data about beef prices or soybean yields to make decisions about planting and selling their goods in an ever-changing global market.\r\n",
      "-- Experts warned the funding lapse could affect the 2020 Census, even as the Census Bureau says it has enough money for up to eight weeks of work. Tara Bahrampour reports: The bureau is relying on $1.056 billion in forward funding from the fiscal 2018 bill, which can be used only for 2020 Census activities and not for other work, to last into mid to late February. But Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former staff director of the House census oversight subcommittee, estimated it would be hard to work full-bore on that amount of funding until then. I believe they will be able to last that long only if they delay or slow-walk some of the less urgent but no less important preparations, she said.\r\n",
      "-- More immigration fallout: Some foreign tech workers are considering moves to Canada as Trump threatens their visa program. Emily Rauhala reports: Trump has vowed to crack down on the H-1B visa program, which allows 85,000 foreigners per year to work in specialty occupations in the United States. But there are no new rules yet, creating a climate of uncertainty and fear, particularly in Silicon Valley. Immigration lawyers and recruiters on both sides of the border say the number of inquiries from nervous H-1B holders has skyrocketed since 2017. A small group of Canadian entrepreneurs are dropping into Silicon Valley to persuade companies that rely on foreign tech workers to move them across the border.\r\n",

I want to make clear that we have no interest in inappropriately interfering with any ongoing criminal investigations, and to that end, we are in the process of consulting with special counsel [Bob] Muellers office, Cummings said, promising that the panel would announce more information about the hearing in the coming weeks.

      "-- Bob Mueller's prosecutors questioned one of Trumps campaign pollsters. CNNs Sara Murray and Katelyn Polantz report: Mueller's team met with pollster Tony Fabrizio in February 2018, an interview that has not been previously reported and takes on new significance after Manafort's attorneys revealed Tuesday that Mueller's team is still interested in how Manafort shared polling data with his Russian intelligence-linked colleague. A veteran pollster and political strategist, Fabrizio worked on Ukrainian elections with Manafort and went on to serve as the Trump campaign's chief pollster beginning in the spring of 2016. A source familiar with the special counsel's interest said Fabrizio's interview included questions about his polling work for Manafort in Ukraine rather than his internal Trump campaign polling. It is not clear what other topics were broached in the interview or whether it solely focused on Fabrizio's knowledge of Manafort's business dealings.\r\n",

      "-- Filings from the Mueller investigation indicate the special counsel may weigh Trumps public statements when considering whether he committed obstruction of justice. CNNs Evan Perez, Pamela Brown and Laura Jarrett report: As [Mueller] wraps up his Russia probe, investigators have focused on conflicting public statements by [Trump] and his team that could be seen as an effort to influence witnesses and obstruct justice, according to people familiar with the investigation. Court filings from [Michael Cohens plea] included allegations related to false public statements not usually considered illegal since they aren't made directly to investigators. A December sentencing memo filed by Mueller's office notes that Cohen's lies were amplified in public statements, including to other potential witnesses.\r\n",

Karoun Demirjian reports: The Mueller probe is the big issue for me  he reassured to some extent. The hard questions have to get asked in the public and get on the record, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the Senate Judiciary Committees ranking Democrat, said of her Thursday morning meeting with Barr. Feinstein is one of five Judiciary Committee Democrats who met with Barr on Thursday, after several complained they were being iced out of his schedule and being told it was due to the partial government shutdown.\r\n",
      "-- After meeting with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin behind closed doors, House Democrats called for a delay in easing sanctions on a Russian company controlled by an ally of Vladimir Putin. Jeanne Whalen reports: Treasury notified Congress last month that it planned to lift sanctions on Rusal, an aluminum company controlled by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. This, with stiff competition, mind you, was one of the worst classified briefings weve received from the Trump administration, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said after the briefing. The secretary barely testified. He answered some questions, but he didnt give testimony. Asked whether House Democrats were considering introducing a resolution of disapproval to try to stop Treasury from easing the sanctions, as Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer has done in the Senate, Pelosi said: Well see.\r\n",
      "-- Federal prosecutors are probing whether Ukrainian lawmakers and business leaders who attended Trumps inauguration were there to try to ease sanctions on Russia. The New York Timess Kenneth P. Vogel, Scott Shane, Mark Mazzetti and Iuliia Mendel report: Evidence of the Ukrainians presence eventually prompted interest from [Mueller] as he investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election, and has spawned a number of related inquiries by federal prosecutors. The investigations are playing out against growing indications that some of the Ukrainians who came to Washington for the inaugural, or their allies, were promoting grand bargains, or peace plans, that aligned with Russias interests, including by lifting sanctions. Such a deal would not just have given the new administration additional flexibility to bring Moscow into American diplomatic efforts in the Middle East, but could also have eased the way for a cast of characters with ties to Mr. Trump some of whom in turn had ties to the Ukrainians who came to Washington to move ahead on business deals that had been complicated by the sanctions.\r\n",

Ashcrofts request for Galloways help followed a report by The Kansas City Star in October that out-of-state campaign consultants, who would go on to run Hawleys Senate campaign, gave direct guidance and tasks to taxpayer-funded staff in the attorney generals office as they sought to raise his national profile. \r\n",
      "Eighty-five pages of records released by Hawleys office shortly before Christmas confirmed The Stars reporting. Those documents show public employees in his office used private email addresses for official business and frequently took direction from political consultants.

Politicos Zachary Warmbrodt reports: The assignment, which lawmakers say they expect her to receive, would pit the 29-year-old New Yorker not only against banks that make up a major local industry but also potentially against business-friendly Democrats who have backed financial deregulation. Some moderate Democrats have privately raised concerns that theyll be targeted by the former bartender-turned-progressive icon, whose willingness to challenge her partys establishment propelled her to Congress and the national spotlight.\r\n",

Instead he painted a picture of a Middle East cast into chaos by [Obama], and that can only be rescued by crushing Iran.

      "When adults are asked to think about what the United States will be like in 2050, they see the country declining in stature on the world stage, a widening gap between the haves and the have-nots and growing political polarization. They think health care will be less affordable, public education will be lower quality and retiring will be harder.\r\n",

That survey also found 71 percent saying they think partisan disagreements have reached a dangerous new normal. Most of this group (39 percent) thought this was the new normal, rather than temporary. Seven in 10 respondents thought divisions in this era are at least as big as during the Vietnam War, including 77 percent of people who were adults in the 1970s.\r\n",
      "-- Finally, most Americans dont think solutions to our problems will come from Washington. In fact, 55 percent in the Pew poll said Washington will have a more negative impact than a positive one. The country continues to be divided over the role of government: Six in 10 fear the government will do too little to solve problems, while 39 percent worry that the feds will be too involved in issues that are better left to businesses and individuals.

Instead, she found that her 27 fellow E.U. leaders took back decision-making from her, dictating a political calendar for the coming weeks that gives both sides time to prepare for the worst-case scenario. If British lawmakers approve a divorce deal they have twice rejected, they can leave the European Union on May 22.

Rob has yet to publicly show regret or contrition for his actions.Giving him a voice before he has done that critical work elevates his opinions above my and [his first wife] Colbies dignity.

The Los Angeles Timess Molly O'Toole scoops: Marine Corps Gen. Robert Neller said the unplanned/unbudgeted deployment along the border that [Trump] ordered last fall, and shifts of other funds to support border security, had forced him to cancel or reduce planned military training in at least five countries, and delay urgent repairs at bases. He complained about canceling or shrinking the Marines participation [in training exercises] at a time where we are attempting to double down on strengthening alliances and attracting new partners. While the armed services chiefs often warn of budget shortfalls, independent experts who reviewed Nellers memos described the language as unusually strong, in particular because it cites the presidents highest-profile political priorities.\r\n",
      "--The Trump administrations plans to take money away from military construction projects to pay for the border wall would potentially deal an outsized blow to Puerto Rico and undermine a program that is helping European allies project strength against Vladimir Putin and his revanchist Russia. Paul Sonne and Erica Werner have a sophisticated analysis: Under pressure from lawmakers, the Defense Department released a list Monday detailing $12.9 billion in military construction projects that had received money from Congress but had yet to be contracted. The Pentagon hasnt said which specific projects would be defunded. But it has ruled out taking money from military housing projects or contracts due to award before the end of the fiscal year. When those are stripped out, the refined list decreases to $4.35 billion worth of projects that are actually vulnerable. The Trump administration plans to take up to $3.6 billion, or 83 percent, for the wall, meaning most of the projects on the shorter list face could be defunded.\r\n",
      "On the most-vulnerable list is some $745 million worth of projects for the European Deterrence Initiative, which was launched in 2014 to help shore up the defenses of our European allies after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine: The 23 European projects in the program at risk are aimed at making it easier for allied forces to respond to any Russian military actions in Europe. ... The initiatives at risk include a plan to build a facility for Special Operations forces and their training in Estonia; projects to construct ammunition and fuel storage facilities and staging areas in Poland; and planned upgrades to aircraft surveillance facilities in Italy and Britain, as well as airfield and fuel storage upgrades in Slovakia and Hungary.\r\n",
      "Puerto Rico is the most affected U.S. territory or state, with 10 projects at a value of $403 million on the smaller list. Here are the others that stand to lose the most under Trumps plan. Note that only three of the top 10 are red states:\r\n",
      "-- The law of unintended consequences: Trumps fixation on securing the border has caused more attempts by migrants to reach U.S. soil by sea. Dan Lamothe reports: The migrants enter in various ways, including on personal watercraft and small, open-top motorboats known as pangas that often arrive under cover of darkness, said Jeremy Thompson, [CBPs] director of marine operations in San Diego. Chief Patrol Agent Rodney S. Scott, who oversees CBP operations in San Diego, said that he expects smugglers to adjust their tactics as U.S. officials alter theirs, and he believes that the United States is taking away most of the low-risk ways to get into the country.\r\n",
      "-- The rising rate of apprehensions at the border is complicating Democratic messaging against Trumps declaration. Democrats have previously pointed to the low apprehension numbers to deride Trumps immigration proposals, but the latest surge of migrants has robbed them of a favorite talking point. David Nakamura reports: Over the first five months of fiscal 2019, CBP had apprehended 268,044 migrants, on pace for more than 643,300 this year. If reached, that total would be the most since 705,005 in 2008 and more than twice as high as the 310,531 migrants taken into custody two years ago. Trump and his supporters have been quick to use the new data to try to heighten tensions about threats at the border and paint Democrats as indifferent to an issue the president plans to make a central issue of his reelection campaign.\r\n",
      "-- But, but, but: The climbing numbers are largely fueled by migrant families who are reaching U.S. soil and seeking asylum, a problem that would not be addressed by a wall. Nick Miroff and Karly Domb Sadof report: [One] group of 127 Guatemalan migrants had waded through the river to turn themselves in to U.S. agents, the first step in initiating the asylum process. They crossed the border illegally, but they have the legal right to seek asylum because they reached U.S. soil. Border Patrol agents must take them into custody and begin processing their claims. [I]n private, [Homeland Security officials] acknowledge that the migration surge is likely to continue with or without a wall, and they fear it possibly could accelerate without changes to the U.S. asylum system.\r\n",
      "-- Federal agents set a record for the number arrests of undocumented immigrants with no criminal records who are already in the country. Earlier in his presidency, Trump ordered ICE agents to arrest all undocumented immigrants they encounter, no matter their criminal record.

According to data released Thursday, that percentage fell to 63.5 percent in December, the lowest monthly figure since ICE started categorizing arrests in 2012. That means 36.5 percent of the arrests were simply undocumented with no criminal history.\r\n",

It is not uncommon for companies like Boeing to charge extra for plane upgrades, but while some of those add-ons are aesthetic, some of them can affect a jets navigation and communication systems. Following the deadly crashes, Boeing intends to make one of the safety features a standard part of its fixes to make planes operable again. (New York Times)\r\n",

      "-- Two pilots filed FAA complaints about Ethiopian Airlines safety procedures years before this month's crash. Aaron Gregg reports: The 2015 complaints, filed before the Max 8 was in use, are critical of training and pilot documentation on the 737 in use at the time, as well as two larger Boeing planes. They could also lead to renewed scrutiny of Ethiopian Airlines, a fast-growing international airline that has enjoyed a generally positive safety reputation in international aviation circles. One pilot said the airline didnt have the infrastructure to support the fleet of Boeing and Airbus jets it ordered, and alleged the airline had a fear-based management culture in which safety is being sacrificed for expansion and profit margin.\r\n",

      "-- Continuing his penchant for making major foreign policy announcements via tweet, the president endorsed permanent Israeli control of the disputed Golan Heights, saying the area is of critical importance to Israel. Anne Gearan, Loveday Morris and Carol Morello report: The position is a political boon to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu days before he is scheduled to visit Washington and three weeks before he faces an unexpectedly difficult reelection vote at home. Trumps statement marks an important symbolic reversal of official U.S. neutrality on an issue that is akin to Israels occupation of the West Bank, which was also seized during the 1967 war and is claimed by Palestinians for a future independent state. Trump decided to announce the new position despite concerns among some in his administration that it would put a finger on the scale of Netanyahus election.\r\n",
      "-- Trumps endorsement came as a shock to members of his own Middle East peace team, the State Department and Israeli officials. We all found out by tweet, one Israeli official said.

      "-- Democrats are wrestling over their support for Israel as members of the party stand accused of anti-Semitism, and Trump upends decades of bipartisan consensus by endorsing Netanyahus right-wing priorities. Mike DeBonis, Sean Sullivan and Rachael Bade report: Few Democratic leaders believe the party is in danger of seeing a mass defection of Jewish voters a Jexodus some Republicans are calling for, including Trump but many say they need to redouble their efforts to police anti-Semitic rhetoric and prevent further erosion of support for Israel. Jewish voters typically favor Democrats over Republicans by a remarkably consistent ratio of 2 to 1 or better, according to exit polling dating to 1980. That mission is set to play out next week as thousands of politically active Jewish Americans and allies gather at the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) Policy Conference, with headliners that include Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.).\r\n",

      "-- One way House Democrats are attempting to show that their party still supports Israel after the Ilhan Omar donnybrook is by introducing a bipartisan resolution rebuking the global boycott movement against Israel. Rachael Bade and Mike DeBonis report: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.) and Rep. Bradley Schneider (Ill.) joined with two Republicans to introduce the resolution Thursday. It expresses opposition to any efforts to 'delegitimize' Israel, including the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. The resolution also reaffirms the need for a two-state solution to the decades-long conflict in the Middle East. Many supporters of the BDS movement back a one-state solution combining both Israel and Palestinian territories, which opponents say would upend the existence of a Jewish state. House Democratic leadership has yet to schedule a vote on the legislation, but the sponsors of the measure have talked to leadership amid a quiet push for a vote.\r\n",

Tom Hamburger and Josh Dawsey report: Cummings described the Dec. 19 discussion with Kushner lawyer Abbe Lowell in a letter to the White House counsel in which he requested information about the use of such messaging apps and other communications by White House personnel. Lowell challenged aspects of Cummingss account, writing in his own letter that he did not say that Kushner used WhatsApp to communicate with foreign leaders. He also said he told Cummings and then-House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy, who was also in the December meeting, that he was not familiar with the details of Kushners use of the messaging application and referred them to the White House counsel.\r\n",
      "The use of messaging services such as WhatsApp could run afoul of White House policy and the Presidential Records Act, which prohibits White House officials from sending a record using a nonofficial electronic message account unless the messages are copied to an official account within 20 days. According to Cummingss letter, Lowell said during their December meeting that Kushner was in compliance with records preservations rules because he took screen shots of his communications and forwarded them to his official email or to National Security Council officials. Cummings said Lowell also told him in their December meeting that Kushners wife, presidential adviser Ivanka Trump, was continuing to receive emails related to White House business on her private email account and did not always forward them to her White House account.\r\n",
      "-- A 12-page letter from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to a Republican senator may offer some insight into what Muellers final report might look like. ABC Newss Jonathan Karl reports: The bottom line: Do not expect a harsh condemnation of Trump or any of his associates if they have not been charged with crimes. In the letter, Rosenstein makes it clear he believes the Department of Justice will not and cannot without violating long-standing Department of Justice policy include disparaging or incriminating information about anybody who has not been charged with a crime. If Mueller follows the guidance of the man who appointed him and supervised his investigation, he cannot publicly disparage those who have not been charged with a crime. Rosenstein is emphatic on this point: In fact, disclosing uncharged allegations against American citizens without a law-enforcement need is considered to be a violation of a prosecutor's trust.\r\n",
      "-- Former FBI director Jim Comey writes in a New York Times op-ed that he hopes special counsel Bob Muellers report serves as an example of the resilience of the U.S. justice system. Comey writes: Even though I believe Mr. Trump is morally unfit to be president of the United States, Im not rooting for Mr. Mueller to demonstrate that he is a criminal. Im also not rooting for Mr. Mueller to 'clear' the president. Im not rooting for anything at all, except that the special counsel be permitted to finish his work, charge whatever cases warrant charging and report on his work. I care only that the work be done, well and completely. If it is, justice will have prevailed and core American values will have been protected at a time when so much of our national leadership has abandoned its commitment to truth and the rule of law.\r\n",
      "Comey says he hopes Congress does not try to impeach Trump: I dont mean that Congress shouldnt move ahead with the process of impeachment governed by our Constitution, if Congress thinks the provable facts are there. I just hope it doesnt. Because if Mr. Trump were removed from office by Congress, a significant portion of this country would see this as a coup, and it would drive those people farther from the common center of American life, more deeply fracturing our country.\r\n",
      "-- Former attorney general Jeff Sessions returned to the Justice Department to literally claim back his old chair. Matt Zapotosky reports: As part of a DOJ tradition, Sessions was presented with the brown leather chair he once sat on when he led the department. In a gray suit and a red tie, Sessions sat at the head of the Justice Departments Great Hall, next to William P. Barr, the man Trump picked to replace Sessions. The moment was one that Sessions missed when he was in the department and that some of his supporters thought was overdue. Sometimes attorneys general even get a lavish goodbye. At Eric H. Holder Jr.s send-off, soul legend Aretha Franklin gave a surprise performance, and President Barack Obama cried. Sessions, by contrast, was forced out in a day.  Trump did not attend the ceremony Thursday, but his presence was felt.\r\n",

The Los Angeles Timess Anna M. Phillips and Rosanna Xia report: Among other things, the administration appears to be considering limits to the scope of states review powers and a shorter period of time to process an appeal. The full extent of its plans is unclear. The goal, officials wrote, is to provide greater efficiency and predictability for oil and gas projects language often used to justify deregulation. The oil industry cheered the administrations move. ... 'Republicans are always supposed to be in favor of states rights, said Richard Charter, who has worked on oil issues for 40 years and is a senior fellow at the marine conservation nonprofit Ocean Foundation. But this is in fact an effort to take away states rights when it comes to offshore drilling.\r\n",
      "-- Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie is moving quickly to roll out new rules that would allow more veterans to get their health care from the private sector. Lisa Rein reports: For Trump, giving veterans more choices will probably be a reelection theme next year as he seeks shorter waits and potentially better care for veterans, a crucial constituency. Democrats now in charge in the House are resisting. They say proposed rules on when veterans could go outside VA are too lenient and would damage the government system a long-held fear of Democrats who worry that union jobs will be siphoned off and the government system dismantled.  \r\n",

      "Trump called GM CEO Mary Barra on Sunday and demanded that she reopen the Lordstown factory in Ohio, where 5,400 jobs were lost: Barra tried to tell Trump that she cant do anything right away because GM and the [United Automobile Workers union] will enter negotiations later this year over a new union contract. The fate of the Lordstown plant will be part of that discussion. Trump said he didnt care at all about the union rules, according to the people familiar with the call, and that he wouldnt be happy with token things. Barra tried to emphasize to Trump that the company has been working to relocate workers at Lordstown to other GM factories across the country. About 800 have transferred, according to the union, but Trump wasnt satisfied with that, according to people familiar with the conversation.\r\n",

The House resolution expresses opposition to the presidential order and urges the Pentagon to maintain an inclusive policy allowing qualified transgender Americans to enlist and serve in the Armed Forces, but it would not force the military to change its policy if passed.

Moore blamed the Fed for slowing the economy while championing Trumps policies in a March 13 Journal column that he co-authored.

Politicos Ben White and Steven Shepard report: While Trump appears to be in a much stronger position than his approval rating and conventional Beltway wisdom might suggest, he also could wind up in trouble if the economy slows markedly between now and next fall, as many analysts predict it will. Trumps party managed to lose the House in 2018 despite a strong economy. So the models could wind up wrong this time around. The economy is just so ... strong right now and by all historic precedent the incumbent should run away with it, said Donald Luskin, chief investment officer of TrendMacrolytics, a research firm whose model correctly predicted Trumps 2016 win when most opinion polls did not.

By attacking McCain, Trump allies said Thursday, the president is stoking his supporters rawest emotions and suspicions about the GOPs political elite. And there is an audience.

A mixed marriage is one of those D.C. cultural curiosities, normally a red and blue pairing, a Capulet and a Montague, a fiery, bipartisan union that means every Sunday brunch is their own, private, Meet the Press panel, and its passion, not politics, that keeps them together.

      "In the spring of 1972, John Mitchell resigned as attorney general to become Nixons campaign manager for his reelection. And in June, Martha joined her husband in California for several campaign events. It was there, on the night of June 17, that John Mitchell got a call about some arrests made at the Watergate Hotel. Mitchell realized that if his wife found out that she knew one of the men arrested, James McCord, she might become upset and tell reporters about it, thus tipping them off to the connection between the burglars and the president. So as he headed back to Washington, he instructed security guards working for the campaign to keep his wife in the dark in California and to stop her from calling members of the media. But find out she did, and just as her husband predicted, she soon called UPIs Helen Thomas. The conversation ended abruptly when it appeared that somebody had taken the phone from her hand, Thomas reported. She was heard to say, You just get away.\r\n",
      "Martha Mitchell later said one of the guards discovered her and ripped the phone from the wall. She was kept in the hotel room for days, she said, where the guard held her down as a doctor injected her with sedatives, her young daughter watching the whole time. Im black and blue, she told Thomas days later. Im a political prisoner.

      "-- New York Times, A New Age of Warfare: How Internet Mercenaries Do Battle for Authoritarian Governments, by Mark Mazzetti, Adam Goldman, Ronen Bergman and Nicole Perlroth: Today even the smallest countries can buy digital espionage services, enabling them to conduct sophisticated operations like electronic eavesdropping or influence campaigns that were once the preserve of major powers like the United States and Russia. Corporations that want to scrutinize competitors secrets, or a wealthy individual with a beef against a rival, can also command intelligence operations for a price, akin to purchasing off-the-shelf elements of the National Security Agency or the Mossad. ... A months-long examination by the New York Times, based on interviews with current and former hackers for governments and private companies and others as well as a review of documents, uncovered secret skirmishes in this burgeoning world of digital combat. \r\n",

      "Content:  544 PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - A dispute between Haiti and a U.S. energy trading firm is leading to long blackouts and fuel shortages in the Caribbean nation, feeding anger at President Jovenel Moise’s government following the collapse of a supply deal with Venezuela last year. \r\n",
      "    The capital Port-au-Prince’s fragile power grid was dealt a blow when Novum Energy Trading Corp suspended shipments in February, leaving residents without electricity for days and many gas stations with no fuel at the pumps. \r\n",
      "Novum says the government owes it $40 million in overdue payments for fuel. Haitian officials did not reply to requests for comment. \r\n",
      "The Western Hemisphere’s poorest nation, Haiti long relied on fuel shipments from nearby OPEC member Venezuela, which offered cheap financing to several Caribbean nations to buy its gasoline, diesel and other products through a program called Petrocaribe. \r\n",
      "    But the scheme fell apart last year due to economic turmoil in Venezuela, forcing Haiti - a nation of 11 million people - to return to international markets. \r\n",
      "    Novum, which has supplied Haiti with fuel for more than four years, stepped up its shipments as the Petrocaribe deal unravelled. Novum said it supplied 80 percent of Haiti’s gasoline and diesel needs last year. \r\n",
      "On Feb. 27, Novum anchored a vessel carrying 150,000 barrels of gasoline off Port-au-Prince until the payment dispute could be resolved. The cargo was equivalent to roughly half of Haiti’s monthly consumption of gasoline, according to industry experts. \r\n",
      "   After more than a month waiting, Novum on April 4 said the situation was “untenable” and sent the vessel to Jamaica to take on provisions. \r\n",
      "Youri Chevry, mayor of Port-au-Prince, a sprawling city of more than 2.6 million people, said electricity and gasoline shortages had grown worse over the past month as Haiti waited for the shipment. \r\n",
      "“It’s a very bad situation ... It has a lot of repercussions,” he said. \r\n",
      "    Chris Scott, Novum’s chief financial officer, said the vessel would not dock until the government could pay. He said Novum had taken such measures “fairly regularly” since mid-2018 as Haiti started to fall behind on payments after the Petrocaribe program collapsed. \r\n",
      "    “They need to pay in order for us to be able to discharge,” Scott said. \r\n",
      "   A government official, who asked not to be identified, said fuel distribution companies in Haiti had not paid the government for gasoline and diesel it purchased on their behalf from Novum. That in turn meant the government could not pay the U.S. company for the fuel. \r\n",
      "    The official said other companies were still supplying Haiti with fuel. He did not provide details. \r\n",
      "The scarcity of fuel and growing economic problems has put basic necessities increasingly out of reach for many Haitians, despite a $229 million loan program from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached last month. \r\n",
      "“I’m barely surviving,” said 40-year-old Amos, one of scores of hawkers selling black market gasoline on a busy street in the capital. On bad day, he earns little more than 50 cents. “It’s going to be difficult to see change in this country.” \r\n",
      "PROTESTS \r\n",
      "Protesters have for months agitated to remove Moise, a former businessman who took office in February 2017. They blame him for inflation running at around 17 percent, the depreciation of the gourde currency, and for not investigating alleged misuse of Petrocaribe funds by public officials. \r\n",
      "Between Feb. 7 and Feb. 27, the protests claimed at least 26 lives and injured more than 77 people, according to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, though the situation has calmed since then. \r\n",
      "    Moise has refused to step aside, saying in February he would not hand power to the leaders of violent protests. He pledged his government would take steps to address people’s grievances. \r\n",
      "Corruption is a perennial concern in Haiti. The nation ranked 166 from 183 countries in Transparency International’s global survey of perceptions of corruption last year - only Venezuela had a worse ranking in the Western Hemisphere. \r\n",
      "International pressure has grown for an investigation. In a March 20 letter, 104 member of the U.S. Congress asked President Donald Trump’s government to support investigations into Petrocaribe in Haiti, pointing to the alleged misuse of $2 billion in low-interest loans under the scheme. \r\n",
      "At the height of the Petrocaribe program, Venezuelan fuel covered nearly 70 percent of Haiti’s needs. Venezuela provided long-term financing for the oil on flexible terms, with a maximum 2 percent interest rate and a two-year grace period. \r\n",
      "Petrocaribe included a fund for infrastructure and social projects in member countries. \r\n",
      "By April 2018, Venezuela was no longer exporting fuel to Haiti, according to documents from Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA seen by Reuters. \r\n",
      "After the program lapsed, Haitian energy companies lacked the hard U.S. currency to be able to buy fuel on international markets, said an executive at one firm, who asked not to be identified. \r\n",
      "Andre Michel, an opposition leader looking into the alleged corruption surrounding Petrocaribe, said it was difficult to estimate how much was stolen but the signs of misused of funds appeared compelling. \r\n",
      "    “No serious projects have been completed: no hospitals, no campus for students, no roads, no housing projects,” he said. \r\n",
      "An oft-heard lament on the streets of Port-au-Prince is that while politicians pilfer billions, Haitians go hungry. Roads in the city are potholed and the vestiges of a deadly 2010 earthquake can still be seen at practically every corner. \r\n",
      "    Destine Legagneur, a small business owner, whose shop is a stone’s throw from the presidential palace, said Haitians would be scarred by the Petrocaribe scheme for years to come. \r\n",

      "Another senior government official told reporters that about 300 militants had been killed. \r\n",
      "On Thursday, though, a senior defence official appeared to backtrack on the claims. Asked about how much damage the warplanes had caused, Air Vice Marshal R.G.K. Kapoor said it was “premature” to provide details about casualties. But he said the Indian armed forces had “fairly credible evidence” of the damage inflicted on the camp by the air strikes. \r\n",
      "India’s previous death toll estimates have been rubbished by Pakistan, which says the operation was a failure that saw Indian jets bomb a largely empty hillside without hurting anyone. \r\n",

There has been little sign as yet of the opposition pushing the government and the armed forces for more evidence of the mission’s results. \r\n",

      "By Sonali Paul \r\n",
      "MELBOURNE, April 9 (Reuters) - France’s Total SA and its partners on Tuesday signed a long-awaited deal with Papua New Guinea that will allow initial work to start on a $13 billion plan to double the country’s liquefied natural gas exports. \r\n",
      "Developing the Pacific island nation’s gas reserves is seen as crucial to its economy as LNG is its biggest export earner, while demand for the fuel is surging in international energy markets. \r\n",
      "Total partner Oil Search said in a statement the agreement would allow the parties to start early engineering and design work, including tendering for contractors, for Papua LNG, a project led by Total, with Exxon Mobil Corp and Oil Search. \r\n",
      "They now aim to make a final investment decision in 2020, targeting first production in 2024, Oil Search said. \r\n",
      "Australia’s Oil Search had first hoped the agreement with the government would be sealed in 2018, as the partners are racing against LNG projects in Canada, Mozambique, Qatar and the United States to meet an expected supply gap in Asia in the early 2020s. \r\n",
      "The agreement was delayed after an earthquake hit PNG in February 2018, which sapped government resources and slowed negotiations over issues such as how much gas from Papua LNG would be reserved for the domestic market and how the government’s share of costs would be managed. \r\n",
      "“This is a major milestone for the Papua LNG project,” Oil Search Managing Director Peter Botten said in a statement. \r\n",
      "Papua LNG plans to develop the Elk and Antelope gas fields to feed two new production units, or trains, to be built at the PNG LNG plant run by Exxon Mobil. \r\n",
      "At the same time, Exxon Mobil plans to add a third new train at PNG LNG, to be fed with gas from its existing fields and a new field, P’nyang, down the track. \r\n",
      "Together, Papua LNG and the Exxon Mobil expansion are set to roughly double exports from the PNG LNG plant to 16 million tonnes a year. Analysts estimate the overall expansion will cost around $13 billion. \r\n",
      "“It has taken longer to get the gas agreement signed than expected. But it is completed and on reasonable terms. LNG expansion is now inevitable,” Bernstein analysts said in a note. \r\n",
      "EQUITY STAKE \r\n",
      "An agreement on the P’nyang development is expected to be signed in the current quarter, said a spokesman for PNG’s state-owned Kumul Petroleum. \r\n",
      "“Dialogue is ongoing with the PNG government to conclude the required gas agreement for the P’nyang project,” Exxon Mobil said in an emailed statement. \r\n",
      "Under the deal signed on Tuesday, the government will gain a 22.5-percent equity stake in the Papua LNG project. \r\n",
      "Total, Exxon and Oil Search have agreed to shoulder the government’s share of the costs incurred leading up to a final investment decision until production begins. \r\n",
      "“We are particularly pleased that the joint venture partners have agreed to assist Kumul ... and that brings certainty to (Kumul) exercising its fully equity entitlement of 22.5 percent,” Kumul Petroleum Managing Director Wapu Sonk said in a statement. \r\n",
      "However, the government will have to fund its equity share of the overall $13 billion capital cost of the projects, which would be roughly $900 million, assuming construction is 70 percent debt-financed. \r\n",
      "The agreement also requires the companies to reserve around 5 percent of the gas for the domestic market, a key provision to boosting power supply in the impoverished South Pacific nation. \r\n",
      "“We are also delighted that this gas agreement includes provisions to supply gas to the domestic market at competitive prices,” Sonk said. \r\n",

      "The gunman broadcast footage of the attack on one mosque in the city of Christchurch on social media. A “manifesto” was also posted online, denouncing immigrants and calling them “invaders”. \r\n",

      "Content:  550 PRESTON NEW ROAD, England (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Susan and Chris Holliday moved to a rural strip of land in northern England for their retirement, they looked forward to the area’s peacefulness and unspoilt views. \r\n",
      "But in the past couple of years the serenity of Preston New Road, Lancashire, has been shattered for the Hollidays by the passing rumble of trucks, an air quality monitoring van in their carpark and a view dominated by a large rig and flare stacks. \r\n",
      "Hydraulic fracturing, a technique known as fracking that uses a high-pressure mixture of water and chemicals to extract gas from deep within the earth, has moved into the neighborhood. \r\n",
      "“Whereas when we looked out of our upstairs window we used to see green fields, we now see an industrial site,” said Susan Holliday. \r\n",
      "Industry groups say fracking could prove a huge domestic energy source, and that Britain’s shale gas reserves could cut imports of natural gas to zero by the early 2030s - but those living on the frontlines fear their homes could pay the price. \r\n",
      "The Hollidays said they were concerned about property damage, earthquakes and health implications. \r\n",
      "Late last year, British shale gas developer Cuadrilla began fracking operations at Preston New Road, making it the site of the country’s first fracked horizontal well - a return to work in the area by Cuadrilla after a seven-year hiatus. \r\n",
      "The company halted operations in 2011 when earthquakes measuring 2.3 and 1.5 on the Richter scale were linked to fracturing of its nearby Preese Hall well, causing public protests and an overhaul of regulations. \r\n",
      "PROPERTY CONCERNS \r\n",
      "Although fracking has grown rapidly in the United States, it has been banned in France, Germany and several other European countries. \r\n",
      "Britain supports the industry as a way to reduce reliance on imports of natural gas - which is used to heat about 80 percent of Britain’s homes - as it prepares to leave the European Union. \r\n",
      "Holliday worries that Brexit may erode “human rights and environmental protections”, making it easier for fracking operations to continue with fewer safeguards for those living near sites. \r\n",
      "Many of her neighbors also fear declining property values, she said, with some struggling to sell their homes. \r\n",
      "“My belief is that these properties at the moment are unsellable, nobody wants to move to an area next to a frack site,” Holliday said. \r\n",
      "In line with common practice for energy-development projects, Cuadrilla offered the Hollidays and others in the vicinity money as part of its community fund - up to 2,000 pounds ($2,600) per household. \r\n",
      "Unclaimed funds will go toward community projects, the company said.  \r\n",
      "Conservative lawmaker Mark Menzies acknowledged the “stress and strain” to those living near the site, but noted he had received only a handful of enquiries from constituents about property concerns. \r\n",
      "Menzies said that fracking had in fact not deterred property developers, who were building about 6,500 new homes in the area. \r\n",
      "“There’s an awful lot of properties being built and a lot of people moving into them within a very, very tight radius of the site,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \r\n",
      "‘GUINEA PIGS’ \r\n",
      "Sitting in his car late at night, anti-fracking activist Gayzer Frackman - who legally changed his name from Geza Tarjanyi in 2012 - prepared to stream his live fracking update on Facebook.  \r\n",
      "Frackman said he felt the 2011 Preese Hall earthquakes in his home and later noticed cracks in the brickwork and damage to doorways. \r\n",
      "“I’d never been in an earthquake before, but it was months later we found out it was about this thing called fracking,” he said. \r\n",
      "Since then, Frackman has been an outspoken critic of fracking and feels residents are treated as “guinea pigs.” \r\n",
      "In 2015, Lancashire officials voted to deny a planning application by Cuadrilla to restart their fracking operations, but their decision was overturned by national government. \r\n",
      "Local councilwoman Miranda Cox also felt the 2011 tremors, and has since taken action to oppose fracking, including being arrested after chaining herself to the gates of the Cuadrilla site. \r\n",
      "“I feel like we’re a sacrifice zone,” she said. \r\n",
      "“If they can do it here, they’ll do it anywhere and that’s why we feel very strongly that we are a front line in the battle.” \r\n",
      "But a Cuadrilla spokesman said “the natural gas beneath Preston New Road could help secure our domestic gas supply,” and reduce carbon emissions associated with gas imports. \r\n",
      "The company has set up websites to help locals understand the shale gas exploration process and regularly publishes results of air and water quality tests, he added. \r\n",
      "KEEP OPTIONS OPEN \r\n",
      "Lawmaker Menzies acknowledged that fracking could be divisive, but warned against blanket criticisms of the industry. \r\n",
      "“I think you’ve got to treat it on a case-by-case basis,” he said. \r\n",
      "He added that he had worked to secure robust regulations around fracking and that it had brought benefits such as jobs and training to the community.  \r\n",
      "“This (fracking) is an option that we have to leave on the table, provided it can be done safely and in an environmentally sensitive way. If it can’t, then we have to take it off the table,” he said. \r\n",
      "Britain currently operates a ‘traffic light’ system, which halts fracking for 18 hours if seismic activity of magnitude 0.5 or above is detected. That has already led to several pauses at Preston New Road. \r\n",
      "In February, fracking companies called on the government to relax the traffic light rules, which they say could thwart the nascent industry. \r\n",
      "However, Britain’s energy minister has dismissed pleas for regulations to be modified. \r\n",
      "Menzies said he also did not support any changes to the system. “The traffic light system is here - don’t touch it.” \r\n",

      "Content:  554 MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Two weeks after a suicide bombing in Kashmir in February killed 40 Indian policemen, a Facebook user called Avi Dandiya posted a live video in which he played a recording of a call purportedly involving India’s home minister, the president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and an unidentified woman. \r\n",
      "The trio could be heard talking about arousing nationalist sentiment ahead of India’s general election, with the BJP president allegedly saying in Hindi: “We agree that for election, we need a war”. \r\n",
      "Within 24 hours, one of Facebook Inc’s fact-checking partners in India, BOOM, exposed Dandiya’s video as fake. An analysis on BOOM’s website said the video was created by splicing audio from older political interviews. \r\n",
      "By the time Facebook took down the post, it had received more than 2.5 million views and 150,000 shares. There is no Indian law that specifically targets fake news, but police in New Delhi registered a case of forgery against Dandiya and an official said investigations were ongoing. \r\n",
      "Still, Reuters last week found at least four edited copies of Dandiya’s videos on Facebook with about 36,000 views. One on Google’s YouTube has been seen 2,800 times while another on Twitter has 22,000 views. \r\n",
      "Messages and e-mails to Dandiya, an avid Facebook user who last appeared in a live video on March 23, went unanswered. The home ministry, the BJP president and party’s information-technology chief did not respond to requests for comment. \r\n",
      "The videos underline how social media companies are struggling with fake news in India despite saying they’ve taken steps to tackle the menace ahead of India’s general election, which starts on April 11. \r\n",
      "With 900 million people eligible to vote and an estimated half-a-billion with access to the internet, fake news can have an enormous impact on the election. Dandiya’s video, for example, could have seriously damaged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP if enough people thought it was true. \r\n",
      "Policing content has become a massive global problem for social media giants which have no template for consistently preventing online fake news or eliminating it. \r\n",
      "Fierce internet disinformation battles gripped countries such as Brazil and Malaysia last year ahead of elections. Authorities in Indonesia and the EU, which are due to hold polls, have warned of the threat of fake news. \r\n",

      "NO SILVER BULLET \r\n",
      "Posts that violate Facebook’s community guidelines, including hate speech or content that could incite violence, are completely deleted, the company said, adding that Dandiya’s video came under that category. \r\n",

Say you're in Times Square in New York, and you want the lights and the buildings in your shot, but you don't want traffic.\r\n",
      "Spectre Camera app for iPhones works like a long-exposure shutter on a camera. It holds the shutter open, so cars, people and moving objects are nearly invisible. The best thing about the app is it doesn't require a tripod for the long-exposure shutter. It's $2.99 in Apple's store.\r\n",

I have been recommending it for years, and I still get people thanking me all the time for saving them time and hassles. Passports are your key to crossing borders, but they are also a source of anxiety and even panic. If you lose it, you’re sunk. This app lets you load your passport’s information onto your smartphone.\r\n",

In theory, this data will revolutionize the way patients are treated and, hopefully, cured.\r\n",

      "Content:  557 CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (Reuters) - Husna Ahmed was 19 when she arrived in New Zealand from Bangladesh on her wedding day. Waiting to meet her was Farid, the man she would marry in a few hours, as their families had agreed. \r\n",
      "A quarter of a century later, the life they had built together was torn apart at the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch when a gunman walked into the building, firing on worshippers at Friday prayers. \r\n",
      "Husna encountered the gunman on his way out of the mosque. He shot her on the footpath. She fell and he fired two more shots, killing her instantly. \r\n",
      "Farid, who uses a wheelchair after an earlier accident, was talking to a friend and was delayed from joining worshippers at his usual spot at the front of the mosque, instead praying in a small side room. \r\n",
      "He managed to escape when he heard the shooting begin, returning when the gunman left, to find many of his friends and community members dead and comfort those who were dying. \r\n",
      "Farid found out about his wife’s death when a detective he knew called his niece as they waited outside the mosque. \r\n",
      "She passed the phone: “I don’t want you to wait the whole night, Farid. Go home, she will not come,” Farid said the detective told him. \r\n",
      "“At the moment I hear that, my response was I felt numb,” Farid told Reuters. “I had tears but I didn’t break down.” His niece crumbled. \r\n",
      "A total of 50 people were killed in the rampage, with as many wounded, as the gunman went from Al Noor to another mosque in the South Island city. \r\n",
      "Most victims were migrants or refugees from countries including Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Syria, Turkey, Somalia and Afghanistan. \r\n",
      "Husna was one of five members of a growing but tight-knit Bangladeshi community killed, according to the Bangladesh consul in New Zealand, Shafiqur Rahman Bhuiyan. Four others were wounded, one critically, he added. \r\n",
      "Members of the Bangladesh cricket team, in town for a test match against New Zealand, narrowly avoided the carnage, turning up at the Al Noor mosque soon after the attack took place. \r\n",
      "Based on what eyewitnesses told him, Farid said instead of hiding, Husna helped women and children inside the mosque and ran to the front of the building to look for him. \r\n",
      "“She’s such a person who always put other people first and she was even not afraid to give her life saving other people,” Farid said. \r\n",
      "Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist, has been charged with murder. He entered no plea and police said he is likely to face more charges. \r\n",
      "The slaughter has rocked Christchurch, and New Zealand, to its core, blanketing the city in grief and driving Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to promise swift gun law reform. \r\n",
      "Farid said he had forgiven his wife’s killer. \r\n",
      "“I want to give the message to the person who did this, or if he has any friends who also think like this: I still love you,” Farid said. “I want to hug you and I want to tell him in face that I am talking from my heart. I have no grudge against you, I never hated you, I will never hate you.” \r\n",
      "LIKE A MOTHER \r\n",
      "A few hours after the massacre as evening fell, the front room of Farid’s home in a sleepy Christchurch suburb where he runs a homeopathy business was full with survivors and friends grieving for a woman many described as like a mother to them. \r\n",
      "Husna was born on 12 October in 1974 in Sylhet, a city on the banks the Surma River, in northeastern Bangladesh. She was so fast that Shahzalal Junior High School would only let her run three races, to give her rivals a chance, Farid said. \r\n",
      "She moved to New Zealand in 1994. \r\n",
      "Thin, nervous and overwhelmed by leaving everyone she knew for a new life in an alien country, she burst into tears when her husband-to-be picked her up from Auckland airport. \r\n",
      "He comforted her on the long drive back to Nelson, where he was living, and where she quickly found her feet. \r\n",
      "With almost no other Bangladeshis in the small city, Husna made English-speaking friends and learned the language within six months. Farid said she spoke it with more of a Kiwi accent than he did. \r\n",
      "When Farid’s workmates at a meatpacking plant agreed to work half an hour longer on Fridays so he could take a break to pray, she cooked them a feast every week in thanks. \r\n",
      "And when Farid was partially paralyzed after being run over by a car outside his house, after four years of marriage, she moved with him to Christchurch and became his nurse. \r\n",
      "“Our hobby was we used to talk to each other. A lot. And we never felt bored,” he said. \r\n",
      "REBUILDING CHRISTCHURCH \r\n",
      "When Christchurch was razed by a deadly earthquake in 2011, Husna helped settle an influx of Bangladeshi migrants - qualified engineers, metalworkers and builders - who came to assist the rebuilding of the shattered city. \r\n",
      "Mohammad Omar Faruk, 36, was one of the new arrivals. Faruk was working as a welder in Singapore but leapt at the opportunity to come to New Zealand where working conditions were better and permanent residency was possible. \r\n",
      "Faruk was also killed at Al Noor mosque. \r\n",
      "His employer, Rob van Peer, said he had allowed his team to leave early last Friday after they finished a job by lunchtime, meaning Faruk could attend Friday prayers. \r\n",
      "Van Peer said Faruk was loved by his colleagues for his loyal and friendly personality and fast, precise welds. \r\n",
      "Zakaria Bhuiyan, a welder at another engineering firm, also died. Newly married, he was waiting for a visitor visa so his wife could travel from Bangladesh. \r\n",
      "Mojammel Haque worked as a dentist in Bangladesh and was studying in New Zealand for an advanced medical qualification when he was killed. \r\n",
      "All three men knew Husna, said Mojibur Rahman, a welder and former flatmate of Faruk. \r\n",
      "“It’s really hard because we are a little community but everyone’s living here in unity, we know each other, we share everything with each together,” he said. “Now I don’t know what’s going to happen, how we become normal.” \r\n",
      "The fifth Bangladeshi victim was Abus Samad, 66, a former faculty member of Bangladesh Agriculture University who had been teaching at Christchurch’s Lincoln University. \r\n",
      "CUSTOMS AND CARE \r\n",
      "Many new workers to Christchurch brought young families, or were starting them and Husna took it upon herself to care for women through their pregnancies, often waking Farid at all hours so he could drive her to the births. \r\n",
      "“We think she’s like a motherif there’s something we needed, we go to Husna,” said Mohammed Jahangir Alan, another welder. \r\n",
      "Husna guided his wife, then 19, to a midwife and a doctor and joined her in the delivery room as she gave birth to a baby girl, Alan said. \r\n",
      "A few days later Husna shaved the infant’s head, an Islamic ritual which she did for dozens of children in the community. She was so gentle the baby fell asleep while she pulled the razor over the soft skin. \r\n",
      "Husna would also lead the customary washing and prayer ritual for women who died. She was due to lead a workshop the day after her death to teach other women the process. \r\n",
      "Now, Husna’s devastated female family members will wash her for her funeral, expected later this week. \r\n",
      "“We know she would just want us to be a part of it, to wash her,” said her sister-in-law Ayesha Corner. \r\n",
      "After the burial, Farid says he wants to continue the work he and his wife used to do and to care for their 15-year-old daughter. \r\n",
      "When the lockdown at her school lifted on Friday, their daughter returned home, knowing only her mother was missing and asking where she was. \r\n",
      "“I didn’t miss a second, I said: ‘She is with God,’” Farid said. \r\n",
      "“She said: ‘You are lying’. She said: ‘Are you telling me I don’t have a mother?’” \r\n",
      "“I said: ‘Yes, but I am your mother now and I am your father...we have to change the roles.” \r\n",

      "Title:  558 Fear and favour chill newsroom at storied Japanese paper\n",
      "Content:  558 TOKYO (Reuters) - Early in December, dozens of journalists and editors from the Japan Times gathered for an emergency meeting in a glass-walled conference room in their brand-new 14th floor office. \r\n",
      "On the agenda was a single, incendiary issue: the newspaper’s new descriptions of how Japan compelled thousands of foreigners into military brothels and labour during World War Two. \r\n",
      "In the past, the Japan Times described Korean workers as “forced labourers” and comfort women as those “forced to provide sex for Japanese troops before and during World War II.” \r\n",
      "But the five-sentence note published on Nov. 30 said the country’s oldest English-language paper would refer to Korean workers simply as “wartime labourers.” \r\n",
      "The paper also said that because of the varied experiences of comfort women, it would describe them as “women who worked in wartime brothels, including those who did so against their will.” \r\n",
      "Such terms are social flashpoints in Japan and a topic of bitter dispute with South Korea, whose government argues comfort women were clear victims of wartime abuse. \r\n",
      "The changes come amid simmering tensions; South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled in October that Japanese companies must compensate South Koreans forced to work during the war. \r\n",
      "The executive editor of the Japan Times, Hiroyasu Mizuno, told staff in the December meeting that he had two goals: to avoid creating the perception the paper was “anti-Japanese,” and to increase advertising revenue from Japanese companies and institutions. \r\n",
      "Some readers said the change glossed over Japan’s wartime actions. \r\n",
      "Prominent Japanese conservatives, meanwhile, applauded the move, calling it a coup for nationalist activists agitating for English-language news outlets to change such descriptions. \r\n",
      "In an email, Mizuno told Reuters he and senior editorial managers decided to revise the paper’s descriptions to “better reflect a more objective view of topics that are both contentious and difficult to summarize.” \r\n",
      "He said the Nov. 30 note did not signal a change in the paper’s editorial direction, adding: “I categorically deny any accusations that The Japan Times has bowed to external pressure.” \r\n",
      "The Japan Times has an outsized impact on how the country is perceived abroad - it is distributed in Japan with The New York Times - and is seen domestically as an unofficial style guide for other English-language outlets. \r\n",
      "A New York Times representative said that the editorial operations of the two organisations were separate, and that the paper used precise language on the topic and would continue to do so. \r\n",
      "Reuters interviews with nearly a dozen Japan Times employees - all of whom requested anonymity out of fear of reprisal - along with hundreds of pages of internal emails and presentation materials, show the editorial changes started taking shape when the paper changed hands in June 2017. \r\n",
      "‘ANTI-JAPANESE’ \r\n",
      "Some media critics say self-censorship is a problem in Japanese newsrooms, fed by fear of losing access, advertising revenue and subscribers. \r\n",
      "In the past, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his top aide, Yoshihide Suga, have singled out the liberal Asahi Shimbun for criticism, including over its articles on comfort women and the Fukushima disaster, some of which it later retracted, citing errors. \r\n",
      "Suga told Reuters the government would not comment on media companies’ editorial policies, including those of the Japan Times. \r\n",
      "Conservative groups in Japan have pushed hard to change how Japan’s World War Two activities are described. \r\n",
      "For instance, an Australian-Japanese organisation that protests comfort women statues, saying the monuments feed anti-Japanese sentiment, along with Kent Gilbert, a well-known conservative commentator and lawyer who has worked in Japan for decades, petitioned Asahi Shimbun last year to remove “forced” from its description of comfort women. \r\n",
      "The paper did not amend its wording, saying in a public statement that it took care “to use the most appropriate phrasing” for stories. \r\n",
      "Similar pressure led the conservative Yomiuri Shimbun to apologise to readers in 2014 for using “sex slaves” to refer to comfort women in its English-language edition. \r\n",
      "“The Yomiuri Shimbun apologises for having used these misleading expressions,” the paper’s English site said in a statement at the time. \r\n",
      "The chilling effect in newsrooms often comes from within the organisation, experts say. \r\n",
      "“It’s less a result of direct government pressure and more from people inside newsrooms looking to their superiors and the public,” said Minako Beppu, a journalism professor at Hosei University who studies media censorship. “It’s things like, ‘Let’s not criticise them too much,’ or ‘Let’s tone things down a bit.’” \r\n",
      "At the Dec. 3 staff meeting, Mizuno said the changes were not political. \r\n",
      "“I want to get rid of criticism that Japan Times is anti-Japanese,” he said, according to a transcript and audio recording. \r\n",
      "He added that the decision would attract advertising. A senior manager in charge of sponsored content then said the paper had already increased government ad sales and scored an exclusive interview with Abe after dropping a column by Jeff Kingston, director of Asia studies at Temple University Japan, who had been writing weekly on what he saw as the Abe administration’s historical revisionism. \r\n",
      "“From a journalistic standpoint, that’s fatal, really,” a senior Japan Times reporter responded, according to the transcript. \r\n",
      "A senior South Korean foreign ministry official declined to comment on the Japan Times. \r\n",
      "In December, Reuters received a letter from a Japanese government official objecting to the term “sex slave” in a Nov. 22 article about South Korean comfort women. \r\n",
      "Reuters removed the term because the wording breached the agency's stylebook guidance on \"comfort women.\"(here\r\n",
      "NEW MASTERS \r\n",
      "Founded in 1897, the Japan Times has a circulation of just 45,000. \r\n",
      "After years of losses and the death of its previous owner, the paper - published under the banner “All the news without fear or favour” - was sold in 2017 to News2u, a PR company. \r\n",
      "It’s not unusual in Japan for new management to shift a paper’s editorial stance, and readers may miss subtle changes. \r\n",
      "But a few months after the sale, some longtime contributors, including Kingston, were told their regular columns were being cut. \r\n",
      "“I got an email out of the blue saying, ‘We’re terminating your column,’” Kingston said. \r\n",
      "Mizuno said the paper was open to future submissions from Kingston, but did not say why the column was cancelled. \r\n",
      "“We have retained commentary writers and columnists that are, when appropriate, critical of the Japanese government,” he said in an email. \r\n",
      "Several reporters also said they felt more editorial pressure. \r\n",
      "In August 2017, when a local newspaper reported that Tokyo’s governor would snub an annual memorial for Koreans killed by mobs after an earthquake in 1923, reporters rushed to cover the news. But the reporters said they were particularly shocked when, in an email seen by Reuters, Mizuno told staff, “I think there is absolutely no value for us to report on this.” \r\n",
      "A SWIFT CHANGE \r\n",
      "A few months after the paper’s exclusive sit-down with Abe in February, Mizuno tried to revise the paper’s style on comfort women and other sensitive topics, presenting editors with more than 100 meticulously annotated articles and columns. \r\n",
      "In the notes, seen by Reuters, Mizuno objected to calling comfort women “victims” or mentioning that they included girls; questioned referring to Japan’s occupation of Korea as “brutal”; and criticised the paper’s reporting and stories by wire services, including Reuters, as generally “pro-Korea” and not adequately reflecting Japan’s view. \r\n",
      "“We’re not historians or arbiters of history, nor are we judges,” he wrote. \r\n",
      "Ultimately, he failed to persuade others, and the matter was put on hold. \r\n",
      "But the South Korean court ruling in October led to a swift denunciation from the Japanese government and a flurry of coverage. \r\n",
      "Mizuno turned to senior managers and the board of directors to make broader changes, according to Japan Times employees. \r\n",
      "Around the same time, the ultra-conservative think tank Japan Institute for National Fundamentals called on English-language media and specifically the Japan Times to refer to plaintiffs in the Seoul case as “wartime Korean workers,” leaving out references to coercion. \r\n",
      "Two weeks later, the editor’s note appeared in the Japan Times. \r\n",

      "Title:  560 Fear and favor chill newsroom at storied Japanese paper\n",
      "Content:  560 TOKYO (Reuters) - Early in December, dozens of journalists and editors from the Japan Times gathered for an emergency meeting in a glass-walled conference room in their brand-new 14th floor office. \r\n",
      "On the agenda was a single, incendiary issue: the newspaper’s new descriptions of how Japan compelled thousands of foreigners into military brothels and labor during World War Two. \r\n",
      "In the past, the Japan Times described Korean workers as “forced laborers” and comfort women as those “forced to provide sex for Japanese troops before and during World War II.” \r\n",
      "But the five-sentence note published on Nov. 30 said the country’s oldest English-language paper would refer to Korean workers simply as “wartime laborers.” \r\n",
      "The paper also said that because of the varied experiences of comfort women, it would describe them as “women who worked in wartime brothels, including those who did so against their will.” \r\n",
      "Such terms are social flashpoints in Japan and a topic of bitter dispute with South Korea, whose government argues comfort women were clear victims of wartime abuse. \r\n",
      "The changes come amid simmering tensions; South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled in October that Japanese companies must compensate South Koreans forced to work during the war. \r\n",
      "The executive editor of the Japan Times, Hiroyasu Mizuno, told staff in the December meeting that he had two goals: to avoid creating the perception the paper was “anti-Japanese,” and to increase advertising revenue from Japanese companies and institutions. \r\n",
      "Some readers said the change glossed over Japan’s wartime actions. \r\n",
      "Prominent Japanese conservatives, meanwhile, applauded the move, calling it a coup for nationalist activists agitating for English-language news outlets to change such descriptions. \r\n",
      "In an email, Mizuno told Reuters he and senior editorial managers decided to revise the paper’s descriptions to “better reflect a more objective view of topics that are both contentious and difficult to summarize.” \r\n",
      "He said the Nov. 30 note did not signal a change in the paper’s editorial direction, adding: “I categorically deny any accusations that The Japan Times has bowed to external pressure.” \r\n",
      "The Japan Times has an outsized impact on how the country is perceived abroad - it is distributed in Japan with The New York Times - and is seen domestically as an unofficial style guide for other English-language outlets. \r\n",
      "A New York Times representative said that the editorial operations of the two organizations were separate, and that the paper used precise language on the topic and would continue to do so. \r\n",
      "Reuters interviews with nearly a dozen Japan Times employees - all of whom requested anonymity out of fear of reprisal - along with hundreds of pages of internal emails and presentation materials, show the editorial changes started taking shape when the paper changed hands in June 2017. \r\n",
      "‘ANTI-JAPANESE’ \r\n",
      "Some media critics say self-censorship is a problem in Japanese newsrooms, fed by fear of losing access, advertising revenue and subscribers. \r\n",
      "In the past, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his top aide, Yoshihide Suga, have singled out the liberal Asahi Shimbun for criticism, including over its articles on comfort women and the Fukushima disaster, some of which it later retracted, citing errors. \r\n",
      "Suga told Reuters the government would not comment on media companies’ editorial policies, including those of the Japan Times. \r\n",
      "Conservative groups in Japan have pushed hard to change how Japan’s World War Two activities are described. \r\n",
      "For instance, an Australian-Japanese organization that protests comfort women statues, saying the monuments feed anti-Japanese sentiment, along with Kent Gilbert, a well-known conservative commentator and lawyer who has worked in Japan for decades, petitioned Asahi Shimbun last year to remove “forced” from its description of comfort women. \r\n",
      "The paper did not amend its wording, saying in a public statement that it took care “to use the most appropriate phrasing” for stories. \r\n",
      "Similar pressure led the conservative Yomiuri Shimbun to apologize to readers in 2014 for using “sex slaves” to refer to comfort women in its English-language edition. \r\n",
      "“The Yomiuri Shimbun apologizes for having used these misleading expressions,” the paper’s English site said in a statement at the time. \r\n",
      "The chilling effect in newsrooms often comes from within the organization, experts say. \r\n",
      "“It’s less a result of direct government pressure and more from people inside newsrooms looking to their superiors and the public,” said Minako Beppu, a journalism professor at Hosei University who studies media censorship. “It’s things like, ‘Let’s not criticize them too much,’ or ‘Let’s tone things down a bit.’” \r\n",
      "At the Dec. 3 staff meeting, Mizuno said the changes were not political. \r\n",
      "“I want to get rid of criticism that Japan Times is anti-Japanese,” he said, according to a transcript and audio recording. \r\n",
      "He added that the decision would attract advertising. A senior manager in charge of sponsored content then said the paper had already increased government ad sales and scored an exclusive interview with Abe after dropping a column by Jeff Kingston, director of Asia studies at Temple University Japan, who had been writing weekly on what he saw as the Abe administration’s historical revisionism. \r\n",
      "“From a journalistic standpoint, that’s fatal, really,” a senior Japan Times reporter responded, according to the transcript. \r\n",
      "A senior South Korean foreign ministry official declined to comment on the Japan Times. \r\n",
      "In December, Reuters received a letter from a Japanese government official objecting to the term “sex slave” in a Nov. 22 article about South Korean comfort women. \r\n",
      "Reuters removed the term because the wording breached the agency's stylebook guidance on \"comfort women.\"(here\r\n",
      "NEW MASTERS \r\n",
      "Founded in 1897, the Japan Times has a circulation of just 45,000. \r\n",
      "After years of losses and the death of its previous owner, the paper - published under the banner “All the news without fear or favor” - was sold in 2017 to News2u, a PR company. \r\n",
      "It’s not unusual in Japan for new management to shift a paper’s editorial stance, and readers may miss subtle changes. \r\n",
      "But a few months after the sale, some longtime contributors, including Kingston, were told their regular columns were being cut. \r\n",
      "“I got an email out of the blue saying, ‘We’re terminating your column,’” Kingston said. \r\n",
      "Mizuno said the paper was open to future submissions from Kingston, but did not say why the column was canceled. \r\n",
      "“We have retained commentary writers and columnists that are, when appropriate, critical of the Japanese government,” he said in an email. \r\n",
      "Several reporters also said they felt more editorial pressure. \r\n",
      "In August 2017, when a local newspaper reported that Tokyo’s governor would snub an annual memorial for Koreans killed by mobs after an earthquake in 1923, reporters rushed to cover the news. But the reporters said they were particularly shocked when, in an email seen by Reuters, Mizuno told staff, “I think there is absolutely no value for us to report on this.” \r\n",
      "A SWIFT CHANGE \r\n",
      "A few months after the paper’s exclusive sit-down with Abe in February, Mizuno tried to revise the paper’s style on comfort women and other sensitive topics, presenting editors with more than 100 meticulously annotated articles and columns. \r\n",
      "In the notes, seen by Reuters, Mizuno objected to calling comfort women “victims” or mentioning that they included girls; questioned referring to Japan’s occupation of Korea as “brutal”; and criticized the paper’s reporting and stories by wire services, including Reuters, as generally “pro-Korea” and not adequately reflecting Japan’s view. \r\n",
      "“We’re not historians or arbiters of history, nor are we judges,” he wrote. \r\n",
      "Ultimately, he failed to persuade others, and the matter was put on hold. \r\n",
      "But the South Korean court ruling in October led to a swift denunciation from the Japanese government and a flurry of coverage. \r\n",
      "Mizuno turned to senior managers and the board of directors to make broader changes, according to Japan Times employees. \r\n",
      "Around the same time, the ultra-conservative think tank Japan Institute for National Fundamentals called on English-language media and specifically the Japan Times to refer to plaintiffs in the Seoul case as “wartime Korean workers,” leaving out references to coercion. \r\n",
      "Two weeks later, the editor’s note appeared in the Japan Times. \r\n",

      "Lisa Johnson told CBS affiliate WMAZ-TV that she called authorities at the VA April 5 to warn them about her brother, Navy veteran Gary Pressley. \"I told them, you know, my brother's there in the parking lot and that he has a gun and he's talking about killing himself,\" Johnson told the station.\r\n",
      "Pressley was found dead inside his car at the VA medical center in Dublin, Georgia, WMAZ-TV reported, citing a police report. \"I just wish they would have found him and stopped him, locked him up, did whatever they had to do because I need my son here,\" his mother, Machelle Wilson, told the station.\r\n",
      "She said her son couldn't get the help he needed after he was in a car accident and discharged in 2012 and that he was haunted by what he saw serving in Haiti after its devastating earthquake in 2010. \"He started talking about, 'Mom, I'm just, I can't, I don't have the fight in me anymore,'\" Wilson told the station.\r\n",
      "Officials at the medical center wouldn't comment to the station about Pressley, citing patient privacy concerns. In a statement, the center said it was reviewing its policies and procedures.\r\n",
      "On the day after Pressley died, over 125 miles away from Dublin, authorities said another veteran shot himself to death outside the VA medical center in Decatur, Georgia, outside Atlanta. Olen Hancock, 68, shot himself outside the center's main entrance, the DeKalb County Medical Examiner's Office told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\r\n",
      "Hancock was seen pacing in the center's lobby before he went outside, WSB-TV reported. Three days later in Texas, another veteran took his own life.\r\n",
      "The unidentified veteran shot himself to death inside a VA clinic in Austin, KXAN-TV reported. Witnesses told the station there were hundreds of people inside the waiting room on the clinic's first floor when shots rang out.\r\n",
      "CBS affiliate KWTX reported the veteran's case was transferred to the clinic from a hospital in Temple, about 65 miles away. \"When he found out he couldn't get the help he needed there, he chose to take his own life,\" McLennan County Veteran Services Officer Steve Hernandez told the station.\r\n",
      "According to the VA, about 20 veterans die by suicide every day. \"These are tragedies that we hear about far too often,\" Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Johnny Isakson said in a statement in the wake of the two deaths in his home state of Georgia.\r\n",
      "Isakson's counterpart in the House, Chairman Mark Takano of California, said in a statement that three other veterans have died by suicide on VA property this year. \"This is a national crisis that we all need to address,\" Takano said.\r\n",

      "Title:  565 It Was Just a Kayaking Trip. Until It Upended Our Lives.\n",
      "Content:  565 The whale sighting happened right away, minutes into Day 1. Jon, Dave and I had just been dropped off on a remote Alaskan shoreline, an hour and a half by boat from the closest speck of a town. Jon was working as a sea-kayaking guide that summer in Glacier Bay National Park, and he had invited us up for a seven-day excursion during his week off. As the boat that delivered us vanished, the drone of its engine dampening into a murmur and then finally trailing off, it became unthinkably quiet on the beach, and the largeness and strangeness of our surroundings were suddenly apparent. It was a familiar phenomenon for Jon from the start of all his trips: a moment that people instinctually paused to soak in. To me, it felt like those scenes of astronauts who, having finally rattled free of the earth’s atmosphere, slip into the stillness of space. Except we weren’t in space. We were on earth — finally, really on earth.\r\n",
      "We were only starting to move around again, packing our gear into the kayaks, when we heard the first huff of a blowhole, not far offshore.\r\n",
      "Jon was ecstatic. It seemed to him as if the animal were putting on a show, swimming playfully in the kelp, diving, resurfacing, then plowing its open mouth across the surface to feed. He took it as a good omen. Though I had no idea at the time, he was anxious that Dave and I might feel intimidated about making the trip; such a big payoff, so quickly, would get us excited and defuse any apprehensions.\r\n",
      "For Dave, the whale-sighting had exactly the opposite effect. Once, when he was a kid, his dad took him scuba diving with dolphins. They were friendly, awe-inspiring creatures, purportedly, but they terrified Dave instead. He could still conjure the feeling of hanging defenselessly in that water while the animals deftly swirled around him, less like solid objects than flashes of reflected light, while he could move only in comparative slow-motion. Ever since, he had harbored a fear of large sea creatures — a niche phobia, particularly for a young man who lived in the Bronx, but a genuine one still. And so, even as Dave understood that a chance to see whales up close like this was a major draw of a kayaking trip in Alaska, and though he feigned being thrilled, some second thoughts were kicking in: We were going out there, he realized.\r\n",
      "The whale left me exhilarated and gleeful, like Jon; but deeper down, I also remember feeling shaken, like Dave. Nothing about the animal registered to me as playful or welcoming. It just appeared in the distance, then transited quickly past us, from left to right. My uneasiness had something to do with the whale’s great size and indifference — its obliviousness — as it passed. Watching it made me feel profoundly out of place and register how large that wilderness was, relative to me.\r\n",
      "At the time, I was working at a literary magazine in New York City called The Hudson Review, picking poems out of the slush pile and mailing them to an outside panel of editorial advisers. I was trying hard in my letters to impress one of them: Hayden Carruth, a gruff and irreverent 81-year-old poet who lived far upstate. I loved Carruth’s work but was more enamored with his persona: his yeoman life in the woods, his intolerance for phoniness and, most of all, the precision with which he articulated common suffering, including one strain of his own suffering that I related to, particularly in those years, but wouldn’t have had the courage, or clarity, to examine.\r\n",
      "“I had always been aware,” Carruth once wrote of his youth, “that the Universe is sad; everything in it, animate or inanimate, the wild creatures, the stones, the stars, was enveloped in the great sadness, pervaded by it. ... Never then or now have I been able to look at a cloudless sky at night and see beauty there. A kind of grandeur, yes — but not beauty. The profusion and variety of celestial lights have always frightened me. Why are they there? Why these instead of others? Why these instead of nothing?”\r\n",
      "That was how I felt, watching the whale from the beach: afraid that everything was accidents. Then again, maybe it’s just hard to picture the start of the trip in retrospect without amplifying some feeling of foreboding. Something else Carruth wrote that has always stuck with me: “The wilderness begins at the edge of my body, at the edge of my consciousness, and extends to the edge of the universe, and it is filled with menace.”\r\n",
      "[Read about Aleksander Doba, the 71-year-old who kayaked across the Atlantic 3 times.]\r\n",
      "It was mid-August 2002, and we were 23, 24 and 25. We had graduated from college together two years earlier. Dave, whom I also grew up with, shot out of undergrad knowing he wanted to be a doctor and had just finished his first year of medical school. Any similar momentum I had after graduation was instantly sapped. Three nights after I returned to my parents’ house from school, I found myself driving my father to the emergency room. Three weeks after that, he died. My grief was disorienting and total; at a moment in life when everything is supposed to feel possible, making any single decision became impossible. I gave into that sadness for the better part of a year, resettling at home in New Jersey with my widowed mother and sliding back to the summer job I worked during school, glumly breaking down beef at a butcher shop two towns over.\r\n",
      "I coped with my fatherlessness and confusion in ways I’m not proud of and still don’t understand. I read a lot of books about Ronald Reagan, for example, even the collection of his love letters to Nancy. I also lashed out at Dave, who was living at home that summer, too, studying for the MCAT. He withdrew awkwardly after the funeral, and I suppose I was happy to hold that against him. It triggered some longstanding jealousy. A part of me always resented how he seemed unfairly exempt from the self-doubt and heaviness that I was prone to.\r\n",
      "Jon, meanwhile, was teaching at a rustic little boarding school in Switzerland, where his mother was from. The summer after graduation, before starting the job, he set out for Alaska with a friend, sleeping in the bed of their old pickup. In the minuscule town of Gustavus, the gateway to Glacier Bay, he picked up seasonal work in the warehouse of a kayak-tour company. Jon had little actual experience of sea kayaking but had always felt drawn to the ocean in the abstract. In college, he and another friend plotted out a paddling expedition near Glacier Bay, across the border in Canada and applied for a grant from our school to fund it. The grant was set up in memory of an alumnus who died in an avalanche while mountaineering. It was meant to encourage the “responsible and conscientious pursuit of wilderness expeditions.” Safety was key. But the committee rejected Jon and his partner’s application. They seemed insufficiently prepared.\r\n",
      "That wasn’t surprising. Jon grew up doing a lot of backcountry camping and was a competent outdoorsman, but putting together a grant application required a kind of administrative fastidiousness he didn’t always possess. He was bright but scatterbrained, forever picking up things and putting them down, both figuratively (music projects, conversations) but also literally. I can still picture him hustling around the house we shared in college, hunting for his keys or his soldering iron, having gotten in over his head rewiring some device. He was an artist; one piece I remember consisted of a half-peeled banana, implanted with circuitry and suspended in a jar of formaldehyde. Once, he grew grass in our upstairs bathroom — a living bathmat, he said — until the turf became muddy and flooded the downstairs.\r\n",
      "This was Jon’s third summer in Alaska, and he’d worked his way up to leading expeditions, taking out vacationers for days at a time. Our trip, however, would venture beyond the typical circuit, into a remote corner of the park that he’d never been to. Jon had no serious concerns about our safety, but he felt he bore responsibility for our emotional well-being. To enjoy ourselves, we would need to feel comfortable, not just in the wilderness but also with him as a leader.\r\n",
      "He suspected we wouldn’t trust him entirely. We didn’t. We knew him before he became a professional guide, and our perception of his expertise lagged behind the reality. “With Jon,” Dave told me, “it was always unclear to what extent he’d thought everything through.” Dave remembered landing in Gustavus the night before we got underway and casually asking Jon a lot of questions: Where are we going, exactly? Do we have everything we need? Jon seemed to have solid answers for all of them. As we headed back to his place for a good night’s sleep, he told us to wait in the yard. He was living alone for the summer in a house that an acquaintance was building in the woods. The structure was framed-up but largely wall-less, and Jon, to be safe, needed to check that no moose had wandered in.\r\n",
      "After a spectacular first day of paddling, we came ashore on a rocky tidal flat about two miles from where we were dropped. Jon gave us his detailed tutorial about bear safety while we set up our campsite. He taught us, for example, to holler “Hey, bear!” if we heard any rustling but also preventively, ahead of us, when we walked through the woods. The last thing you wanted was to come across a brown bear unannounced.\r\n",
      "“Hey, bear!” Jon kept hollering, by way of demonstration. He said it goofily, like a children’s TV host greeting some down-on-his-luck ursine neighbor at the doorway to their clubhouse. This was intentional. Jon had noticed that the people on his trips often resisted bellowing “Hey, bear!” into the wilderness. It was essential for their safety, but it felt silly or vulnerable somehow, like singing in public. So he learned to turn it into a shtick, spinning it into a stream-of-consciousness narration: Hey, bear, I’m coming into the trees now. Hope you’re having a fantastic evening, Mr. Bear! It loosened everyone up. They were performing for their friends now; the whole group was in on the joke.\r\n",
      "I had never seen a wild bear, though I have backpacked in bear country a handful of times. I felt comfortable with the animals in the abstract. But here, the bears weren’t abstract; they breached the material plane. There were bear trails everywhere, leading from the tree line to the water, and disquietingly close, I felt, to where we were pitching our tent. We found heaps of their scat. We saw trees where the animals had slashed off the bark to eat the inner layer, tufts of fur from their paws still plastered in the sap.\r\n",
      "I pretended I was having fun. But that evening I grew increasingly petrified, almost delirious. My eyes tightened, scanning for bears. The sound of the wind became bears, and so did the mossy sticks cracking under our feet. I gave myself a migraine, then phased in and out of sleep.\r\n",
      "At sunrise, I woke feeling foolish. While Jon cooked pancakes, I reasoned with myself, privately, in a notebook I brought on the trip. I tried to conceive of the situation as a geometry problem. Yes, some number of bears roved this landscape, I wrote: relatively tiny, independent blips, going about their business randomly, just like us. In all that empty space and confusion, a lethal collision of their moving blips and our moving blips would be an improbable coincidence. I’d been distorting those odds, mistaking myself for “the absolute focus of all bears’ attention,” I wrote. It was embarrassing, really. “To be afraid of bears,” I concluded, “is to be narcissistic.”\r\n",
      "I was reminding myself that freakishly horrible things are, by definition, unlikely to happen. Even now, my reasoning feels sound.\r\n",
      "[Read about the search for a missing hiker in Joshua Tree’s wild interior.]\r\n",
      "Day 2 was a slog. We paddled through a spitting drizzle in an endless straight line, along the high granite walls of the coast. We talked less and less, just pushed through the emerald chop. Then eventually we gave up, hauling in our boats and making camp in a wide, crescent-shaped cove, short of the site that Jon originally picked out on his map.\r\n",
      "We had entered Dundas Bay, a rarely visited pocket of the national park that, I’ve since learned, has a storied history as a hide-out for solitary misanthropes. In the 1930s, one prospector built a cabin not far from our campsite and brandished a gun at the Alaska Natives who passed through.\r\n",
      "We intuited that the scenery was beautiful, but we could see very little of it through the fog. Our guidebook explained that “the east side of the bay” — where we were — “can get extremely rough during foul weather, since large waves roll in ... and batter this shoreline.” That was happening now: The weather that plinked at us all afternoon was roiling into a storm. Soon, the big rain started. We rushed through dinner, then loafed in our tent until, eventually, the loafing turned to sleep.\r\n",
      "A local newspaper would later describe the storm as “short but intense.” In Gustavus, a creek swelled to about a foot higher than its previous record. Gale winds, with gusts up to 59 miles per hour, turned back two cruise ships in Skagway, about 85 miles north. Around 2 a.m., we woke to discover the wind had shorn the rain fly off our tent. Jon’s sleeping bag and mine were soaked, while Dave was snug and dry between us. We heard torrents of water lashing down and the waves crashing in the cove.\r\n",
      "We got up three or four hours later. The rain and wind no longer felt ferocious but were still too gnarly to paddle through; there was no question, Jon said, that we were staying put. We cooked breakfast and took turns playing chess in the tent. By late morning, the storm seemed to have passed. We were antsy. We figured we would take a look around.\r\n",
      "The terrain was crammed with thickets of alder and spruce, underlain by ferns and a furor of prickly things. Jon pointed out devil’s club: three or four feet tall and leafy, armored up and down with spines. The plant pierced fleece and hurt like fire.\r\n",
      "There were no trails. We’d been trudging for some time when we reached a fast-moving stream, maybe 10 feet wide. Jon was surprised; it wasn’t on his map, most likely just a drainage bloated by the storm. We followed it downstream, looking for a way across, and eventually found it bridged by a hefty tree trunk. It seemed like an easy crossing. Jon stepped up and led the way, and Dave and I waited in a single-file line on the stream bank behind him. The creek was loud, like a factory with all its gears and rollers churning. Looking down, Jon realized there was more water than he’d thought.\r\n",
      "That’s when I heard the snap in the woods behind me. After all my paranoia, I instantly understood that the many bears I’d thought I heard before were absolutely not bears — were nothing — because this sound was so unmistakable and crisp, so explicitly something. I turned and hollered, “Hey, bear!” then waited a beat. Maybe I said “Hey, bear!” again; I’m not sure. But I must have scanned those trees long enough to feel satisfied and safe, because I know I was turning my head, to go back to my friends, when I saw the dark shape rushing forward in my peripheral vision.\r\n",
      "What I heard must have been roots popping. If a tree is large enough, you can apparently hear them cracking underground like gunfire.\r\n",
      "The thud was seismic. The trunk crashed down right next to me. Mapping out bits of evidence later, we concluded that the tree must have been about 80 feet tall and perhaps two feet in diameter. It was some kind of conifer — a spruce or cedar. I screamed, involuntarily, “Look out!” then watched Dave, a few steps directly in front of me, dive sideways and hit the ground. When I got to him, he was crouching, stunned but O.K. He looked up and said, “Go get Jon.”\r\n",
      "It hadn’t clicked back in for me: There were three of us. The sight of Dave going down had canceled out everything else. I scrambled out over the creek, running across the tree that had just fallen, shouting Jon’s name, then spotted him in the water, tangled in a snarl of sheared-off branches near the bank behind me — a cage, which kept him from hurtling downstream.\r\n",
      "He did not know he’d been hit by a falling tree. It had narrowly missed his head, struck his left shoulder, shearing it from his collarbone and breaking many of his ribs. Later, a doctor would explain that the downward force had been so powerful that it had probably squashed Jon’s entire upper body, and all the organs inside, down toward his waist, momentarily compressing him like a bellows; for a split second, his shoulders headed in the direction of his bellybutton, before his torso sprang up again.\r\n",
      "Jon had heard nothing, seen nothing. He was turning around to help Dave onto the log — again, feeling responsible for our safety — and the next thing he knew, he was in the water. He tried to reach out his left arm but could not make it move. He could not move his legs. He felt a bolt of pain down his spine.\r\n",
      "Jon later described flashing through an idiosyncratic sequence of thoughts, all in a few milliseconds, as if watching a deck of cards fanning across a table. One was an image of himself in a wheelchair, sitting behind a mixing console in a fancy recording studio. “I guess I can become a recording engineer in a wheelchair,” he remembered thinking. He had never worked in a recording studio and, though he played music, he had no particular plans to. Still, this vision apparently felt like an acceptable future and freed him to resurface in the present. That was when he registered me, screaming his name.\r\n",
      "Jon told himself he shouldn’t move. He knew from his many wilderness first-responder trainings that moving a person with spinal injuries risks paralysis. Then again, he also knew that most of his body was submerged in cold water, and he recognized that he risked dying of hypothermia if he didn’t move. “If I’m already paralyzed,” he concluded, “I may as well move.”\r\n",
      "He somehow hoisted himself out of the stream before Dave or I got to him, using his right arm and his chin and biting into something loamy with his teeth, for additional leverage. He reassessed the situation: better. Also: worse. He now realized that we were at least a mile inland from our camp.\r\n",
      "Suddenly, his body was walking; his legs just started working. Dave and I put him between us, supporting his frame. He was moving faster than we expected, but uncoordinatedly. Then he crumpled between us. We tried again; Jon was dead weight. Dave noticed that his breathing was shallow and his voice was low — signs, Dave knew from med school, of a collapsed lung. He began battering Jon with a pep talk, telling him, firmly, that he had to get up, that we had to get out of here. Jon didn’t need that explained to him; he was cogent and still trying to plot our next steps in his mind. He looked down to see why this log he was resting on was so lumpy and realized that he was, in fact, sitting on his left arm. The arm was slack, obviously broken; his sleeve, pierced up and down with devil’s club. Jon had zero feeling in it. He found it amusing, this sensation of complete estrangement from one of his limbs.\r\n",
      "Jon had been stressing that it was important to stay together. But this was another theory of wilderness survival that appeared to be breaking down in practice. Someone would have to get on the radio back at our camp. By chance, while marooned in our tent during the rainstorm the night before, Jon showed us how to use the device, though he did it almost as a formality; the hand-held VHF unit was merely a line-of-sight radio, he told us, meaning its range was small, its signal too weak to pass through most obstacles. You were unlikely to reach anyone you couldn’t see, and we hadn’t seen anyone since a faraway fishing boat, early on Day 1.\r\n",
      "There was a moment of discussion, or maybe just an exchange of looks between me and Dave. I told Dave he should go. I didn’t trust myself to find my way back. I also knew that I lacked the courage to try; whether I was being sensible or cowardly, I still don’t know. Besides, I took for granted that Dave would make it. He was more capable in my mind, less likely to cinch himself in indecisive knots.\r\n",
      "Recently, though, Dave told me: “You probably had no idea how much in my own head I was. I know that you, growing up, definitely felt insecure about things, and I think you looked at me and thought, Dave has everything figured out. But I had so much anxiety.” He brought up the tremor he used to have in his hands. I knew about it; in high school, we waited tables together, and I occasionally had to carry out Dave’s soup orders, so he wouldn’t spill. But I guess I thought of the tremor as strictly physiological. I couldn’t see the vulnerability causing it.\r\n",
      "Now, as Dave sprinted away from me and Jon, swatting devil’s club from his path with the rubberized sleeve of his rain jacket, his nerves rose up and rattled him. He worried he wouldn’t be able to find the radio once he got back or know how to turn it on. What if he broke the radio, foreclosing whatever marginal chance we had of getting help? There were lots of ways to screw this up, Dave realized. More occurred to him as he ran.\r\n",
      "He found the radio. He turned it on. Then, having solved these problems, he encountered another he hadn’t anticipated: “What is the appropriate thing you’re supposed to say?” he remembered thinking. On TV, you see a lot of people saying “Mayday.” And so, Dave faced the open water and started broadcasting into the fog: “Mayday, Mayday.” Even in that moment, though, alone on a beach in the middle of nowhere, he felt slightly self-conscious about it. This is so goddamn cliché, he thought.\r\n",
      "Back in the woods, kneeling over Jon, I was having the same problem: I didn’t know what to say. He was lying near a log on his injured side, his beard and glasses flecked with dirt and tendrils of moss. He seemed to be on the brink of losing consciousness. At no time would the possibility of Jon’s dying surface concretely in any of our minds. Still, I knew I was supposed to keep talking to him, to tether him to the world with my voice somehow.\r\n",
      "I started vamping platitudes: We were going to get out of here soon, and so forth. But I could feel myself treading water, even blundering, at one point, into a long-winded apology, worried I overstayed my welcome that one Christmas with his family. I was afraid that the helplessness in my voice might be counterproductive, unsettling Jon instead of steadying him. It was a tremendous silence to fill.\r\n",
      "What can a person say? I had two literature professors in college who made us memorize poems. You never knew when some lines of verse would come in handy, they claimed. One liked to brag that, while traveling through Ireland, he found that if he spat out some Yeats at a pub, he could drink free. This is how I wound up reciting a love poem to Jon.\r\n",
      "It was “The Shampoo,” by Elizabeth Bishop, a lyric poem about the enormity of time, which turns startlingly intimate at the end, when Bishop offers to shampoo her lover’s silvering hair: “Come, let me wash it in this big tin basin,/battered and shiny like the moon.”\r\n",
      "After that, I imagine I also did some W.H. Auden; I knew a fair amount of Auden back then. The stuff in rhyme and meter was always easiest to memorize — “Looking up at the stars, I know quite well/That, for all they care, I can go to hell” — which is why I had a lot of Robert Frost at my disposal as well: “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,”“The Road Not Taken.” For the most part, I trafficked in hits.\r\n",
      "Jon and I would spend about an hour and a half together alone on the forest floor. I ran through everything in my quiver — Kay Ryan, A.R. Ammons, Michael Donaghy — padding each poem with little prefatory remarks, while Jon said nothing, just signaled with his eyes or produced a sound whenever I checked in. I felt like a radio D.J. playing records in the middle of the night, unsure if anyone was listening. And here’s one about owls by Richard Wilbur, I would tell Jon, and off we would go.\r\n",
      "I must have also done at least one by Hayden Carruth, my curmudgeonly pen pal at the literary magazine. Carruth’s poems didn’t lend themselves to memorization, but I’d worked hard to nail one of my favorites, in which he describes stopping to notice a deer standing in an apple thicket, then realizing the northern lights are flaring overhead. Hayden and the animal pass a moment in stillness together. “We are proud to be afraid,” he writes, “proud to share/the silent magnetic storm that destroys the stars.” Relative to that boundless violence above them, he and the deer are momentarily allied, though still not entirely connected: “a glimpse, an acknowledgment/it is enough and never enough.”\r\n",
      "That’s what I said to my friend, powerlessly, tenting my jacket over his face when it started to rain. The title of the poem is: “I Know, I Remember, But How Can I Help You.”\r\n",
      "The Coast Guard cutter Mustang wasn’t where it was supposed to be. The 110-foot patrol boat normally spent its time coursing through the Gulf of Alaska, inspecting halibut-fishing vessels, or circulating, as a terrorist deterrent, near the oil terminals at Valdez. It was home-ported in Seward, hundreds of miles from Glacier Bay. But the crew was transiting to Juneau for a training when, a few days earlier, they were smacked by the same storm that later poured inland, over us. “We had gotten absolutely pummeled,” John Roberts, a petty officer on the Mustang, told me recently. For two days, the boat swished around in 15-foot-plus seas. Many on the crew had been hunkered in the mess deck, vomiting, while Roberts and a couple of his shipmates did their best to cover everyone’s watches. Finally, the Mustang slipped into Glacier Bay to find some protection. The weather started to ease. That afternoon, as Roberts piloted the Mustang east, toward Dundas Bay, his pallid crewmates were finally staggering back up to the bridge, asking where the hell they were.\r\n",
      "That was when Dave’s Mayday call came through. The signal on the Mustang’s radio was thin and faint, barely edging into range. Another of the ship’s petty officers, Eamon McCormack, explained to me that in retrospect the connection feels “mind-boggling.” Glacier Bay National Park extends over more than 5,000 square miles. Our signal would have covered two or three miles at most. And yet, a boat — a Coast Guard boat, no less — happened to be passing through that exceedingly small window at precisely the right time. “I don’t know if, nine times out of 10, you play that over again and the outcome would be the same,” McCormack said. A moment earlier or later — seconds, potentially — and we might have slipped out of alignment. The moving boat would have cruised out of range, uncoupling from us forever.\r\n",
      "It was 1:25 p.m. when the Mustang received Dave’s call, according to one of the subsequent Coast Guard reports. Roberts couldn’t believe it. “Come on, man, I’m tired,” he said aloud, wearily, to the receiver in front of him. Roberts waited for a moment, per protocol, on the off chance that the Coast Guard’s central communications center in Juneau would pick up the call instead. Then he turned and asked his watch commander to pull out all the standardized search-and-rescue paperwork. He was steeling himself, resummoning his professionalism. “I guess we’re doing this,” he said.\r\n",
      "Roberts was the crew member on the Mustang with the most current medical training; he would complete his E.M.T. certification the following month. As he started firing questions at Dave on the radio, he didn’t like the answers that he heard coming back: the shallowness of Jon’s breathing, the likelihood of a punctured lung. More fundamental, Roberts remembered: “Any time a tree falls on somebody, it’s not good.” He was also unsettled to learn that Dave and I both lived in New York City — a red flag, he had found, when someone winds up in trouble in the wilderness.\r\n",
      "We were 100 nautical miles from the nearest hospital; a half-day trip, even in ideal conditions. The Mustang requested that the Coast Guard Air Station in Sitka send a helicopter, but the immediate plan was for Roberts and three crewmates to peel toward shore in the ship’s Zodiac and track us down. Dave had found the flare in Jon’s emergency kit and now, at 2:20, with the Zodiac underway, the Coast Guard asked him to fire it. He was still in front of our campsite, facing the water. He’d never shot off a flare before. He aimed straight up, then watched as the bright tracer rose and arced somewhere far behind him, deep in the woods. He was uncertain whether this counted as a success. He started scanning the fog in front of him, but the Zodiac never appeared.\r\n",
      "Someone on the Mustang caught sight of the flare near the end of its arc and immediately directed the crew on the Zodiac toward it, steering them far away from Dave to the opposite side of the little peninsula we’d camped on. And yet, this was lucky: they wound up coming ashore much closer to where I was waiting in the woods with Jon. Soon, whatever poem I was reciting was interrupted by whistles blowing and voices calling, and eventually three shapes, wearing hard hats and heavy orange rain gear, rushed toward us out of the trees.\r\n",
      "Roberts was especially impressive, a reassuringly large Boston-area native with a booming voice. He knelt and took Jon’s vitals. The information was troubling: his pulse was 60 beats per minute; his breathing, fast and shallow. They put his neck in a brace and eased him onto a kind of truncated backboard, called a Miller board, to move him out to the beach. Dave had returned by then. He and I crouched at one end of the board, near Jon’s feet, as someone — presumably Roberts — bellowed a count of three to lift.\r\n",
      "Later that night, lying down to sleep in a bed-and-breakfast in Gustavus — stunned and depleted, but dry and warm — Dave and I would talk and talk, reviewing the entire ordeal. We had drooped into a long silence, coasting toward sleep, when Dave spoke up with one last observation. When we were getting ready to lift Jon on the backboard, he said, it occurred to him that this was one of those crisis moments you hear about, like when mothers are suddenly able to lift a car off their baby. Dave expected we were going to have superhuman strength.\r\n",
      "We did not have superhuman strength. On Roberts’s command, the men raised Jon to waist height, swiftly and seemingly perfectly level, as though their arms and deltoids were hydraulic. Then, in one motion, they took off downhill, with negligible help from us. This can’t be accurate, but I remember the sensation of being almost dragged, like children in a sled.\r\n",
      "A National Geographic television crew was embedded at the Coast Guard’s air station in Sitka, filming an installment of a thrill-ride reality series. The network had sent crews to other Coast Guard stations around the country too, though this assignment appeared to hold the most dramatic potential. Air Station Sitka was unique: Its pilots were responsible for 12,000 miles of coastline, a sprawling, treacherous wilderness riven with fjords, inlets and glaciers, often buffeted by implacably horrible weather. People who went into the backcountry in Alaska had a way of getting themselves into a different magnitude of trouble, too; as Roberts put it, “When stuff happens in Alaska, it’s big.” Still, this was the television crew’s eighth day in Sitka, and as the show’s producer, Annabelle Hester, explained: “I was having calls with my bosses at headquarters saying, ‘Nothing is happening!’ We were scrambling to come up with Plan B.” Then, the Mustang’s call came in at 1:42.\r\n",
      "“What type of injuries are we looking at?” asked the dispatcher. She was taking the call from behind a semicircular counter, like the reception desk at a midlevel corporate branch office. She had a framed snapshot of a parakeet to brighten her work space, and a photograph of a dog with a heart that said, “I Woof You.” A cameraman stood conspicuously beside her, holding a tense, tight shot.\r\n",
      "“Probable broken ribs, a definite broken arm,” said the man on the other end. Then his voice faltered, seemed to give up: “And whatever else would happen to you if a tree fell on you,” he added.\r\n",
      "The dispatcher retrieved the appropriate paperwork and scribbled “Tree fell on person” on one line. She read the current weather aloud: “30 knots wind, 300 ceiling, heavy rain and one-mile vis.” That would soon be revised: the ceiling had dropped to 100 feet. Entering the weather conditions on one of the Coast Guard incident reports, someone would write, in a kind of nihilistic catchall: “Extremely terrible.”\r\n",
      "The Coast Guard’s policy was to deploy a helicopter within 30 minutes of the initial request, but the Air Station’s operations officer, Cmdr. Karl Baldessari, informed everyone that this mission would take longer to plan. Baldessari was a 25-year veteran of the Coast Guard, a fast-moving, sinewy man in a blousy flight suit, with a tidy mustache and spiky hair. His role at the air station was that of a firehouse chief. He was responsible for the safety of everyone working there, which meant making judicious decisions about what warranted sending them hurtling through the sky.\r\n",
      "That calculus got knotty in conditions like these, though there was a baseline volatility to flying in Alaska at all. The Coast Guard didn’t let its helicopter pilots fly lead out of Sitka, no matter how much experience they had at other air stations, until they practiced difficult landings at specific locations in the region and got their egos battered a little by logging a full winter in the state. Visibility in Alaska was frequently poor; conditions changed quickly. One pilot told me about blindly tunneling through fog in the dark when his co-pilot got “caged”: The man lifted his eyes momentarily from his instruments and, without any visual references or a horizon to latch onto, found it impossible to reorient himself, lost all sense of direction and was felled by vertigo.\r\n",
      "During much of the year it was also cold enough, with sufficient moisture in the air, that ascending to clear the region’s many minor mountains or even just flying through a cloud risked the aircraft’s icing up. To mitigate this, the Coast Guard had laid out virtual “track lines” across the entirety of their range: a grid of GPS points and a network of paths connecting them, along which pilots could chart a course and fly at a relatively low altitude, confident they weren’t going to smash into a mountain. The system wasn’t comprehensive; the track lines got the pilots close to their destination, but ultimately they had to diverge from this GPS superhighway and fly the remaining distance the old-fashioned way, with their radar and eyes. It was like taking an exit off the interstate, except there might be a granite wall in front of you wherever you chose to get off. It was possible the pilots would travel very far — a half-mile away from whoever needed their help — only to discover that the last leg was too risky and be forced to turn back.\r\n",
      "Baldessari gathered the two pilots on duty that afternoon and the Air Station’s flight surgeon, then unrolled a large paper map. He pointed to our location, explaining: “That’s probably one of the lousiest places we fly in and out of. This Inian Pass, right here, is the worst place we could possibly go.”\r\n",
      "Inian Pass is a slim channel near the center of the Icy Strait, the long, interconnected system of waterways stretching through Glacier Bay. Conditions in the Icy Strait can be bad 300 days of the year, Baldessari recently told me; wind, rain and storm surges all push through it fast from the open ocean. But Inian Pass is a narrow keyhole at the center of the strait — a mile-wide opening between a few uninhabited islands and a rocky point — where all that weather speeds up. The only way for the pilots to reach us would be to fly straight through it.\r\n",
      "Nothing in the National Geographic footage, at this point, feels reassuring. The flight surgeon holds his hand over his mouth and bites his lip. The co-pilot, Chris Ferguson, only a few months into his posting in Alaska, mills around and fidgets with his ear. It’s obvious Baldessari needs convincing. He wasn’t eager to send his men up if he didn’t have to and wasn’t certain they would make it all the way there if he did.\r\n",
      "“It’s kind of funny,” he told the pilots, pointing at the map. “You’ve got a boat right here.”\r\n",
      "Lying on his backboard like a burl of driftwood, Jon was conscious and cognizant of his pain, but he had started to feel somehow buffered from his body, uninterested in connecting with the world beyond it. He would later describe himself as a “thinking blob. It was a very passive experience.” He didn’t know what was happening but could tell our momentum had stalled. He was confused and felt impatient. In his mind, the three of us had solved the impossible problem: We’d managed to get help. This was supposed to be the simple part, when everyone rushed him to the hospital. Instead, his condition deteriorated. Within 10 minutes of reaching the beach, Jon threw up. I’d never seen anything like it, a kind of dark purple gristle. I took out my wool cap to wipe his face, and he retched a second time, straight into my hat.\r\n",
      "“I got that all over me,” John Roberts told me recently. He’d seen vomit like that before; it meant Jon had ingested a fair amount of blood and signaled internal injuries. It made Roberts anxious. He had been on the Mustang for two and a half years at that point but had spent the previous four years in Palm Beach, a busy but less extreme posting that often involved rescuing weekend boaters from relatively close to shore — and where, Roberts pointed out, the water is warm and won’t necessarily kill you if you go in. Moreover, the bulk of the Coast Guard’s training is for maritime rescues, not rescues on land. Counterintuitive as it sounds, Roberts’s comfort level and confidence had dropped significantly once he hopped off the Zodiac and set foot on the beach.\r\n",
      "He reported back to the Mustang that Jon had thrown up, then soon radioed again, explaining that Jon was going into shock. He kept giving and requesting updates, trying to gauge how long this might take, and eventually started erecting a makeshift shelter out of plastic sheeting and medical tape, hoping to keep Jon out of the rain. Out of earshot of us, Roberts explained to his crew mate Eamon McCormack what the vomit meant: The possibility of Jon dying, here under their care, was real. At one point in the National Geographic footage, as Roberts’s calls are relayed to the air station in Sitka, you can see where the dispatcher clearly writes on her form: “E.M.T. does not feel comfortable.”\r\n",
      "By this time, the air station’s flight surgeon had received enough information to be alarmed. “It sounds like he’s got a pretty significant chest injury,” he told Baldessari. Baldessari understood they would need to launch a helicopter but warned the Mustang that the aircraft might not make it through the weather; ultimately it would be the pilots’ call, once they veered off their last track line and tried to shoot through Inian Pass.\r\n",
      "They would go and give it a look, Baldessari explained over the radio, but the outlook was iffy. The guys on the beach, he said, must be prepared to get Jon back on their cutter and haul him to a hospital themselves, as fast as they could.\r\n",
      "One evening this winter, my phone rang, and it was Karl Baldessari. Long retired from the Coast Guard, he was teaching aviation at a community college in Oregon, where I left a voice mail message earlier that day. I meanwhile had metamorphosed into a 40-year-old father of two and fumbled to explain to Baldessari that, as thrilled as I was to have tracked him down, I was, at the moment, racing to finish a risotto for my daughters before gymnastics practice and would have to call him back. Without missing a beat, Baldessari blared orders at me, joking, but still sounding as instinctually in charge as he did in the National Geographic footage: “O.K.,” he said, “you want to stir it constantly, but slowly!”\r\n",
      "I didn’t expect any of the Coast Guardsmen I was cold-calling to remember that day. However dramatic it remained for me, I assumed it would have been obscured in a yearslong wash of more sensational incidents. But everyone I spoke to did remember it, immediately and in detail. Baldessari had been involved in hundreds of rescue operations during his 30-year career, and yet, as I stood at the stove on the phone that evening, he told me: “The moment I listened to your voice mail, I knew exactly the case! It was almost like it was yesterday.”\r\n",
      "There was something about the supreme freakishness of the accident that left a lasting impression. For those who came ashore, the experience was also marked by a feeling of subtly escalating chaos and the pressure to surmount it. McCormack told me that ours was a story he retold endlessly, often to the younger Coast Guardsmen he was eventually tasked with training. In it was a lesson about “not taking situations that look impossible at face value,” he said. “When things start to go wrong, don’t panic or lose sight of what resources you’ve got.” Keep working the problem until its absolute end — even, McCormack added, if it means deviating from official policy.\r\n",
      "McCormack was not supposed to be landing an inflatable boat on an unforgivably rocky Alaskan shoreline, for example. But there he was, anyway, beaching the Zodiac as gingerly as he could, so that Roberts and the other men could load Jon aboard. They slid him in on his side “like a folder into a filing cabinet,” as Jon put it, and started motoring through the chop, very cautiously, back to the Mustang, about a mile away.\r\n",
      "As relieved as Jon had been when the Coast Guard first arrived, he also felt instantaneously more vulnerable. Strapped to the back board, his neck in the collar, he surrendered control of his body, however imperfect that control had been. He was being hauled around as an object now, with no ability to wriggle or shift positions, to manage his pain or even to turn his head and see what was happening. He was helpless, entirely dependent on the upright people operating around him, those voices he could hear discussing him on the far side of some gauzy divide. About 10 minutes into the trip on the Zodiac, Jon heard one of those voices say, “Oh, shit, we’re losing air.”\r\n",
      "A section of the Zodiac’s sponson — the inflatable fender that wraps around the boat — had punctured. One side was completely deflated. “It’s a big deal,” McCormack recently explained to me, sounding surprised that I had to ask. The sponson increases the boat’s buoyancy and stability, as well as keeping water from cresting over the side; under normal conditions, a Zodiac with a broken sponson would have been taken out of service automatically. Instead, McCormack found the puncture and wedged the nozzle of a small pump inside. Then — steering the boat with one hand, operating the throttle with the other — he started working the pump with his foot, essentially doing leg presses, to keep the fender partly inflated. The ride was already bumpy in four-foot seas. Now McCormack began tracing a slow, zigzagging course, doing what he could to tamp down the turbulence and the violence to Jon’s spine, as well as to guard against the possibility of the injured man’s suddenly bounding over the side on his backboard.\r\n",
      "Roberts and the other Coast Guardsmen on the Zodiac leaned over Jon to shield him from the splash. The pain was heinous; Jon seemed to be passing out. Roberts talked to him, held his hand. Roberts felt crushed, he told me; he was torturing this guy in order to save him. When they finally reached the Mustang, rather than hoist Jon off the Zodiac, they swung the ship’s crane around and simply lifted the entire boat out of the water, level with the deck, and then carried him aboard, to keep from joggling him any more.\r\n",
      "McCormack eventually returned for me and Dave, and a half-hour later we were reunited with Jon in the Mustang’s athwartship passageway, a cramped, steel hallway, like the space between two cars of a train. Jon was still battened to the backboard, wedged up to keep the weight of his body on his less-painful side. They had cut off his clothes, though he’d murmured a plea not to — he was wearing a brand-new Patagonia jacket that he had borrowed from a friend — then swaddled him in a hypothermia blanket. Dave and I knelt and rubbed his feet.\r\n",
      "The helicopter was going to make it. I don’t remember there being a grand announcement. I’m not sure we were ever made aware of the possibility that it wouldn’t. Now the crew got busy below: tying down anything that could be blown off by the rotor wash or stashing it in the mess. I also don’t remember hearing the helicopter when it finally arrived. Instead, I remember only a heavy door to our left swinging open to reveal, like a scene from an action movie, the silhouette of a man in a blue flight suit, feet planted shoulder-width apart to steady himself as the ship rocked sideways. The cable he’d been lowered on drew back into the ocean spray and fog behind him. “I’m flight surgeon Russ Bowman,” he said and stepped inside.\r\n",
      "Bowman took Jon’s vitals and gave him several, successive shots of morphine. Soon, everyone was working to squeeze him back through the narrow doorway and onto the deck where the helicopter, an MH-60 Jayhawk, was idling overhead.\r\n",
      "Until recently, the story I told about the accident unfolded in two basic acts: the tree fell, instantaneously unleashing a kind of unfathomable chaos; then the Coast Guard appeared and, just as swiftly, regathered that chaos into order. It was like watching footage of an exploding object, then watching it run in reverse. The maneuver the Coast Guard was readying to execute now, on the deck of the Mustang, would be the climax of that progression.\r\n",
      "The helicopter hovered 30 or 40 feet over the boat, mirroring its speed and trajectory, while both vehicles moved slowly forward. “Looks like you’re heading for a rain squall,” the co-pilot, Chris Ferguson, radioed the Mustang at one point, and asked the ship to adjust its course, to keep them in as forgiving weather as possible. Soon the flight mechanic was calling out instructions to tuck the aircraft into alignment: “Forward and right 30. Forward and right 20. Forward and right 10.” Then, finally — speaking, in the flight recordings, with an almost galling air of imperturbability — the lead helicopter pilot, Rich McIntyre, radioed the flight mechanic to begin the hoist.\r\n",
      "The whole procedure, from our vantage point, seemed seamless and routine. In a way, it was: After the agonized deliberation at the air station, the pilots exited off their GPS route into fairly manageable conditions around Inian Pass. The winds were workable; the water wasn’t excessively choppy. Ultimately, scooping Jon off the deck of the Mustang would resemble a standard exercise that the pilots drilled in their trainings. “Not to dumb it down,” the co-pilot, Chris Ferguson, told me — plucking someone with a spinal injury off a moving boat and hoisting them into a moving helicopter is a pretty insane thing to do. “But we normalize what isn’t normal.”\r\n",
      "A few moments earlier, as the men scurried around Jon on his backboard, packaging and fastening him for the hoist, Jon worried that the second he got airborne he would start twirling uncontrollably, like the feathery end of a cat toy, and potentially thwack his head on the equipment on deck. But now, he was levitating smoothly — a solitary, swaddled bale of a man, perfectly perpendicular to the ground. Dave and I watched it happen: our friend rising steadily away from us, improbably, to safety. As Jon floated higher, he could hear the Coast Guardsmen on the Mustang beneath him begin to cheer. He felt it was safe to open his eyes. When he did, he saw someone, hunched in the open cargo door of the helicopter, pointing a television camera at him.\r\n",
      "Video Clip From National Geographic Image Collection\r\n",
      "Jon was rushed into surgery at the hospital in Sitka that evening. He’d punctured both lungs, one to the point of collapse, sustained multiple fractures on eight of his ribs, broken several vertebrae, shattered his left shoulder blade and snapped his brachial plexus nerves. His spleen had been macerated into countless flecks. After awakening from surgery, Jon was disappointed that the doctors had swept those shards into a bag and thrown his spleen in the trash; he wanted to get a look at it, maybe even keep it preserved in a jar, alongside his cyborg-banana.\r\n",
      "Once back in Gustavus, Dave and I realized that we would need to call Jon’s parents in Switzerland. I didn’t have to push the job on Dave this time; he was adamant. He felt he would need to face conversations like these if he was going to be a doctor. It was Jon’s father who picked up, and after absorbing the news, he paused and caught Dave off guard. “Thank you,” he said solemnly. “You guys saved my son’s life.”\r\n",
      "Dave’s stomach dropped. “I remember thinking about it,” he told me recently, “and realizing, Yeah. I guess, logistically, we did.” I had the same reaction when Dave hung up the phone and, clearly shaken, relayed his conversation to me. Until that moment, the idea that we saved Jon’s life had never occurred to us, possibly because the idea that Jon might have died still hadn’t occurred to us. We had zero sense of accomplishment, or even agency. In our minds, all we did was avoid screwing up until the real help could arrive and save him.\r\n",
      "But Jon hadn’t absorbed the story that way. From the instant he willed himself out of the water, he felt all of us locking into that same seamless flow of order steadily displacing chaos that Dave and I only experienced once the Coast Guard arrived. It was amazing to him how the three of us managed to generate solutions for each successive problem. Even my reciting those poems, which to me had always felt like a moment of utter helplessness, became, in Jon’s telling, a perfect emblem of that streak of serendipitous problem-solving. “You conveyed a calmness,” he told me recently. “I remember it being this nice moment.” He added that if he ever has to spend two hours dying on a remote forest floor again, having me there to recite poetry would be one of his top ways to do it.\r\n",
      "The feeling of inevitability that day became only more pronounced for Jon as time passed and the entire story of our rescue receded into a prologue to the rest of his life. The surgery in Sitka was only the first of half a dozen, and it would take several years for him to regain 60 percent of the use of his arm, wrist and hand, as the nerves gradually regrew along his injured side. He was in good enough shape to go back to Alaska the summer after the accident — repairing boats in the company’s warehouse and occasionally helping out at the bed-and-breakfast — but he struggled. He could repair kayaks but needed help lifting them. He was unable to wrestle the mattress corners into the fitted sheets when he made the beds. After that, he started working at a recording studio in Portland, just as he envisioned while stuck in the water, and he now runs his own audio-mastering company: Spleenless Mastering.\r\n",
      "Eventually Jon seemed to have recovered from the accident without any conspicuous disabilities. But his life has been quietly corroded by chronic pain and, almost equally, by the stresses of navigating the doctors, medications (and their side effects) to manage it. About two years after the accident, he learned he had PTSD. The trauma wasn’t the falling tree, but his experience of powerlessness as a perpetual patient in the American medical system. It manifested as a kind of unbearable empathy for anyone who was suffering. Jon found himself shouting at doctors, on his own behalf but also on behalf of strangers in waiting rooms who weren’t being seen. He would hear interviews with natural-disaster victims or the homeless on NPR and have to pull his car over. There continued to be other tribulations, too — more mundane ones. A few times a year, he still rebreaks a rib out of nowhere; once or twice, Jon told me, all it has taken is an especially affectionate hug from his wife.\r\n",
      "Jon found early on that he could cordon off this suffering, both in his own mind and in conversation, by making jokes about the accident itself and sticking to the happy ending of our rescue, a trick that got much easier after the National Geographic show aired later that year. “Mission Rescue: Final Frontier,” the program was called. The soundtrack was all heart-thwacking synth drums and shredding guitar. A foreboding, Ken Burns-effected snapshot of Dave and Jon looking joyful before the trip gave way to a whirring re-enactment of someone else’s legs — cast in the role of Dave’s legs — sprinting through the blurry woods for our radio. A melodramatic narrator pondered the fate of “Kayaker Jon Cohrs.”\r\n",
      "Initially, the schlockiness of the production felt like a blessing. The show depersonalized the accident, giving us all a shorthand to convey how dramatic that day had been, without confronting how destabilizing and senseless it might have felt. At a party, you could lay out the basics — a tree fell on Jon — then say, “National Geographic even made a TV special about it,” and everyone would go wide-eyed but then move on, figuring you would unspool the real story some other time.\r\n",
      "But we never realized the degree to which that kitschy shorthand started to obscure the real story — then, gradually, to replace it. I’m embarrassed to admit that, though Jon and I have remained close, I did not know the extent to which he has continued to suffer for the last 17 years until talking to him for several hours in order to write this account.\r\n",
      "The morning after the accident, Dave and I traveled back to Dundas Bay to pack up our campsite and collect the kayaks we abandoned the previous evening. We were shuttled there from Gustavus by the same boat captain who dropped us off three days earlier, a forbiddingly taciturn commercial fisherman named Doug Ogilvy.\r\n",
      "The tide in the cove was way out when we arrived; it was, as Ogilvy put it, “a suck-ass beach.” The approach was so shallow that he had to drop anchor a hundred yards or more from shore. He asked if we had waders. We did not. So Ogilvy put on his, climbed down the ladder and told Dave to get on his back. Then stoically, like an ox or an old-timey strongman hauling a safe, he trudged through the thigh-high water, dropped Dave on the gravel beach, then lurched back and hauled me the same way, as if I were a man-size infant in a papoose.\r\n",
      "Dave told me he’d had a strange feeling on the ride out, as if we would discover that an even more massive tree had fallen on our tent since we last slept there and that all three of us would have been crushed and killed if we’d spent another night in Dundas Bay, as planned. That is, he half-expected to find evidence that the accident had been fortuitous somehow, that there was a reason, or redemptive value, behind it. My mother had the same instinct when I called her the night before. On the phone I strained to emphasize for her — she was only two years into her cruelly premature widowhood, and I was new at being the overprotective son of a widow — that Jon was going to be all right, and that Dave and I were safe. She told me that my dad must have been up there looking out for us somehow.\r\n",
      "I resented all the supernatural thinking. If it comforted other people, fine, but I’d somehow known right away that I didn’t need a reason for the accident. It was senseless, but straightforward, as unequivocal a fact as my father’s death had been. A tree fell in the woods. It might not have, but it did. Jon could have died, but he didn’t. Other possibilities spiraled infinitely outward from there, though apparently I wasn’t too interested in contemplating them. As strange as it sounds, it was years before I realized that the tree could have hit me — and only after a friend pointed this out, as I told the story around a fire one night. And it was only a few weeks ago, while on the phone with Jon, that it occurred to me that the tree could have hit all three of us — we were standing in a single-file line, after all, waiting to cross the creek — and that we all might have wound up clobbered and scattered in that river, dying slowly and watching each other die.\r\n",
      "It’s also probably true that I helped preclude these possibilities by being so feverishly paranoid about bears, wheeling around at the sound of the snapping roots. That’s what allowed me to see the tree coming, just barely, and scream that infinitesimal heads-up for Dave. And so, the real meaning of the accident, if I felt compelled to find one, might be that it validated my most exaggerated fears. But instead, it somehow helped cleanse me of them. There was comfort for me in accepting the arbitrariness of what happened, in regarding it as a spasm of random damage in time and space that, just as randomly, a small number of human beings got the opportunity to repair. We were more capable than I had understood. We were also far more helpless.\r\n",
      "On the ride back to Gustavus with our gear, I pictured myself, again, as a small blip in empty space. The ride was rough and jumpy as Ogilvy impatiently pounded his boat through the last vestigial wave energy of the storm; Dave and I had to hold on, to plant ourselves on the bench behind him. But there was a moment when I felt so safe that I loosened my grip, leaned slightly into the motion of the boat, and, closing my eyes, felt myself lift off the seat.\r\n",
